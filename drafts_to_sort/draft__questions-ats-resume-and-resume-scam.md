Two things are needed here: 1) clarifying questions so the resume rewrite is accurate and targeted, and 2) a breakdown of why the email thread feels like a sales funnel even though the LinkedIn profile seems legit.

## Questions to tailor an ATS-optimized draft

To rewrite your resume toward this kind of “advanced WordPress / PHP” role, these details are needed so the content stays honest and specific:

1. Target details  
- What job titles are you MOST interested in for this lead? (e.g., “Senior WordPress Developer”, “WordPress/PHP Engineer”, “Full-Stack WordPress Developer”).  
  - **Answer:** Jr. WordPress/PHP Engineer
- Are you aiming fully remote, hybrid, or on-site, and any specific geographic preferences or salary band you want reflected (even if not written explicitly)?
  - **Answer:** Fully Remote $72/hr target W2 contract
1. Quantifiable impact  
For each of these, please give any numbers or best estimates you’re comfortable with:
- ElijahStreams / Elijah List Ministries:  
  - Approx site traffic (monthly visitors or page views) or size (e.g., “high-traffic media ministry site”).  
    - **Answer:** high-traffic media ministry site (~60K monthly visits)
  - Any measurable performance improvements (e.g., page load time reductions, uptime, error rate reduction, plugin count reduced, etc.).
    - **Answer:** I'm unclear how to measure those things. Plugin count was reduced from around 30 to 21 by migrating from Elementor to core WordPress with a custom classic theme  
  - Any specific business results (e.g., increase in conversions, donations, store sales, subscriber signups, or time saved for staff).
  - **Answer:** Yes, but nothing easily quantifiable - several team members and users thanked me for the website redesign, especially since they could search easier than witht the original custom LAMP codebase from 2008 that I replaced with WordPress. Also, creating the Testimonials feature (including form submission and backend custom post type management interface) increased website engagement by 10-13%. At first the person who handled viewer/audience interaction and outreach and engagement had a pain point because he could had to contact me whenever he needed a visitior email who had submitted a testimonial. In WP Forms only admins could access form entries by default, and my manager said not to give Peter admin access. So, it was a quandry. Peter was very appreciative after I created a custom function that interfaced with WP Forms hooks to apply granular permissions for editors to allow them to view and export wp forms entries, only for the 'Testimonials Form' form and nothing else.
- Freelance WordPress work:  
  - Rough number of WordPress sites built.  
    - **Answer:** 6
  - Any notable outcome: revenue increase, leads, signups, speed improvements, or “cut support tickets by X%”.  
    - **Answer:** unsure about metrics. When I re-designed Southeast Alabama Works' (Regional workforce development nonprofit that connects employers, educators, and job seekers in southeast Alabama.) website the whole team was pleased. The Executive director provided this LinkedIn recommendation on my profile: "Eric was extremely professional during the course of our website redesign project. He went above and beyond what we expected from the original construct of our agreement. His advanced knowledge of coding and web design made our online presence much more appealing to our customer base. His attention to detail and organized method of communication and project development were second to none. I highly recommend him for any organization looking to create or restructure their website."
- Earlier PHP/Laravel/Zend roles:  
  - Any performance improvements, revenue impact, or reliability/uptime gains you remember.
    - **Answer:** No, I've had a lot of short contracts that I took and then was terminated after 2-3 monts for not a skills fit, therefore, also, I don't have exact or even ballpark quantifiable metrics

1. Tools, stack, and depth
- Caching/performance: Have you worked with specific caching layers or tools (e.g., WP Rocket, W3TC, object caching/Redis, Cloudflare, server-level caching)?  
  - **Answer:** I have some familiarity with Cloudflare, but this interface is over-complex in my opinion. I know how clear cache with various plugins and how to implement cachebusting in WordPress custom code to prevent vistors from seeing old site versions. I have mid-level caching understanding and I know how to create, update, retrieve, and delete WordPress transients. I'm familiar with various caching plugins, but I can't claim to be an expert with any one. I used WP Engine's built-in server caching @ ElijahStreams and after changing hosts to Ionos, implemented caching on Plesk Obsidian (I think it was on by default, or it was a very simple setup toggle situation)
- Security: Any specific hardening practices beyond WordFence (e.g., least-privilege access, 2FA, login rate limiting, custom capability management, backups/restore tests)?  
  - **Answer:** I know how to enable 2FA and I implemented both Duplicator and UpdraftPlus for scheduled backups to cloud in various projects
- APIs & integrations: Which APIs have you integrated with in WordPress/PHP (e.g., payment gateways, mailing services like Mailchimp, SendGrid, REST/JSON APIs)?
  - **Answer:** I've created custom function that integrates a star wars api based on a tutorial in a cusotm wordpress function, and I began attempting to integrate AWeber API, but I never completed it. API integration is something I know about and understand the basic concept of web servicese and rest, but I don't have much actual successful practice integrating client apis in wordpress  
- Dev workflow: Do you use Git branching/PRs, staging environments, deployment scripts, or CI/CD in any roles, or mainly manual deployment via Plesk/cPanel?
  - **Answer:** Yes: Git branching/PRs, staging environments, pre-deployment scripts with webpack/LaravelMix (although I don't use Laravel at all)
1. Leveling and leadership
- Have you mentored juniors, led projects, or been the “go-to” person for architectural decisions in any roles besides ElijahStreams?  
  - **Answer:** In tech I've not mentored anyone. I have answered tech questions people have asked in online forums like Reddit and StackOverflow to help give back to the community. I also participated in many community projects for different groups including one that open source began a project of designing an open source carpooling / ride share app (for resume experience) where I served as Project Manager as well as developer in a small team of 4, and another small team of 6 I served as the graphic designer creating mockups for a nodejs based CMS with a wordpress-like bakend UI
- Any experience writing coding standards, doing code reviews, or defining best practices?
  - **Answer:** Yes, I'm great at writing all sorts of technical documentation - it comes so naturally that its hard to quantify achievements. Documentation has normally been a secondary function of the roles I've been in where it was expected but not really honored or appreciated fully. I've written coding standards, best practices, faqs, created document templates, proficient in creating styled markdown documents, participated in multiple code reviews and pull request reviews, created SOPs checklists and some call it "runbooks" although I don't use that term.

1. Employment details checks
- Exact city/state for each employer when relevant (you have Geneva, AL and remote; anything you want standardized, e.g., “Remote – Geneva, AL” vs just “Remote”).  
- Any roles you want de-emphasized or condensed further (e.g., older non-dev roles) to keep the resume to 2 pages.
  - **Answer:** YES, I'd be happy if the following could be condensed a little more, perhaps merged into a single section. Maybe there should be a subgroup for short contracts and a separate subgroup for longer contracts and permanent roles?:

## EARLY CAREER SUMMARY

15+ years IT service, hardware support, and technical sales including:

- **Field Service Engineer**, Hewlett-Packard (2005-2009)
- **AIX Helpdesk Analyst**, IBM Rochester (2000-2002) 
- **Technical Support**, Mattel Interactive (1999)

**ADDITIONAL NEW INFO:** I created an open-source custom object oriented Wordpress random bible verse rotator plugin that simply showed a different randomly chosen bible verse each time the page refereshed. I even went through the whole approval through WordPress organization using the SVN submission process in 2022 and had my plugin published on the plugin libary for WordPress.org. I removed the plugin in 2023 to prevent people using it because I wasn't able to keep up with implementing security measures to meet new coding / technology developments / requirements. This was a resume project I did for fun to demonstrate my skills but once I got hired I didn't really have time to maintain the plugin

Once you answer those, a revised, ATS-optimized version can be drafted around this kind of job lead (focusing on custom themes/plugins, scaling, performance, security, APIs, and long-term ownership).

## Why Jenna’s email feels like a funnel

There are a few structural and behavioral markers that often show up in “resume service funnel” emails, even from real people:

- Use of an ATS score as a scare hook  
  - Dropping a specific low score (e.g., “33%”) without sharing the tool or a detailed report is often used to create urgency and insecurity so the candidate feels they “need help now.” Many resume/ATS tools and services explicitly market in this way, using low scores to pitch paid rewrites or coaching.[1][2][3]

- Framing your experience as strong but the resume as “broken”  
  - The pattern “your background is solid, but your resume isn’t optimized / it’s not ATS-friendly / it doesn’t show your value” is a very common script in resume sales funnels: praise + problem + offered solution.[4][5]
  - Phrases about “strategic keywords,” “quantifiable achievements,” and “today’s highly competitive market” are typical copy used by services that sell resume overhauls, not just standard recruiter outreach.[5][4]

- Open-ended offer to “guide you through improving it”  
  - Genuine recruiters sometimes give specific, actionable feedback for free (e.g., “change your title to X, move skills above experience, add Y technology to your skills section”).  
  - Funnel-style emails instead stay high-level and then move toward a call/consultation, where a paid product (resume rewrite, coaching, or course) is pitched.[3][5]

- Mismatch between professional identity and email channel  
  - A recruiter who looks legit on LinkedIn but is writing from a generic Gmail address, rather than a company domain, raises mild caution; it is a common pattern among independent resume/consulting sellers and occasionally among scammers.[3][5]
  - This does not prove bad intent; independent recruiters and consultants often use Gmail. It just means you treat it more like a business pitch than purely a recruiter working a specific requisition.

Taken together, it likely means:
- Jenna may be a real person with a legitimate LinkedIn presence who also sells resume/ATS optimization, coaching, or related services.  
- The email is written in a style that blends recruiting language with copywriting intended to move you toward a paid service or at least a “discovery call.”

If you want to proceed safely, you can:
- Ask directly: “Are you recruiting for a specific client/role right now, or is this primarily a resume/ATS optimization service?”  
- Decline any paid service while still asking for 1–2 specific, concrete suggestions (“Could you give me two specific formatting or keyword changes you’d recommend for WordPress/PHP roles?”).  
- Only share your updated resume and personal information once you’re clear on whether there is a real job requisition behind the outreach.

If you reply with answers to the questions above, the next step will be a fully rewritten, ATS-optimized resume draft aligned with this kind of long-term WordPress/PHP role, in clean, scanner-friendly format and language.
