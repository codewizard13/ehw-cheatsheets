Here's a clear human-friendly approach with emojis to explain your situation and the best practice:

***

🚀 When cleaning up your local repo, it's totally fine to create a commit and push a pull request for these changes. Just keep in mind:

- 🔒 If the files you're deleting are already ignored by the production build process, this won't affect the live environment, so no worries there.
- 💡 Cleaning your personal repo is great hygiene and helps keep the codebase maintainable for everyone.
- 🤝 To avoid confusion, write a clear commit message explaining the purpose, like "chore: remove ignored backup files to tidy repo."
- 📢 In your PR description, mention explicitly that these files were ignored and that this cleanup is for repo health.

✨ This way, your teammates understand the intent, the production build remains unaffected, and the repo stays clean.

Optional bonus tips:

- 🧹 Consider doing these cleanup commits on a separate branch called something like `chore/repo-cleanup`.
- 🔄 Regularly sync your repo with `master` to avoid conflicts.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Review the files carefully before deleting to avoid removing anything important.

In short, pushing cleanup commits and PRs is good practice as long as you communicate the context clearly!
