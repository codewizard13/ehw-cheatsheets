## 🌐 Websites Project Structure on D:\Websites

The **Websites** folder serves as the central hub for all your web projects. Each site has its own clearly named folder to ensure intuitive access and easy management.

### Structure Layout:
```
Websites\
├── Organic Harvest Ministries\
│   ├── Docs\             # All site-related reference materials, design files, assets, and documentation
│   ├── Assets\           # Optional folder for images, screenshots, color palettes, and other media
│   ├── Link -> ...       # Shortcut or symbolic link to the live website folder or repository for direct access
├── EricHepperle.com\
│   ├── Docs\
│   ├── Assets\
│   ├── Link -> ...
├── Eric Hepperle Designs\
... and so forth for each site ...
```

### Key Benefits:
- **Clear Separation:** All documentation, assets, and metadata live within the site folder, keeping everything organized in one place without mixing with code repositories.
- **Direct Website Access:** The `Link` at the root level of each site folder provides a fast, connected pathway to the actual website’s working directory or repository, easing navigation and reducing overhead.
- **Backup Efficiency:** Large site media and docs remain separate from live code repos, preventing unnecessary bulk during backups and improving performance for tools like UpdraftPlus or Duplicator.
- **Scalable & Maintainable:** This scheme adapts easily for new sites or reorganizations and makes long-term maintenance straightforward.

This organization balances clarity, accessibility, and backup efficiency aligned with modern web development and deployment best practices.
This updated section can fit seamlessly into your overall D: drive reference documentation. If desired, it can be enhanced with sample README text or folder creation scripts.

## 📝 Notes & Best Practices

- **Backups:** Keep large bulky assets (designs, screenshots) outside active repo folders to keep backups efficient.
- **Temporary Cleanup:** Regularly prune `_tmp` and sandbox folders to avoid clutter.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use clear folder names for archives/reference docs for easy future retrieval.
- **Document Changes:** Use README files inside major folders to document project status or instructions.
- **Cloud Sync:** Consider syncing critical reference folders for remote access and redundancy.
