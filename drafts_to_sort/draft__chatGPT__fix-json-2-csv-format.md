It looks like the "JSON to CSV" extension you're using in VS Code is outputting **CSV** that’s valid for machines, but not easily human-readable — likely because it’s dumping **entire arrays or objects into a single CSV cell** as stringified JSON, rather than flattening them.

### Let’s unpack what's happening:

Your CSV starts like this:

```csv
open.all
"[""imap://codewizard13%40gmail.com@imap.gmail.com/INBOX"",""mailbox://nobody@Local%20Folders/Trash"",""mailbox://nobody@Local%20Folders/Unsent%20Messages""]"
```

This is:

* **One column header**: `open.all`
* **One value**: a **stringified array**, with quotes escaped (`""` instead of `"`), making it hard to read and essentially unreadable in standard CSV viewers (like Excel or VS Code's CSV viewer).

---

### 🧠 Why Prettier won’t help:

Prettier only formats code (JS, JSON, HTML, etc.), not CSV data. It won’t touch `.csv` files, and even if it did, it wouldn’t know how to “prettify” stringified arrays inside cells.

### ✅ Solution Options:

#### 🔹 Option 1: Use a **JSON Flattener** before converting to CSV

Instead of directly converting your JSON to CSV, **flatten the JSON** first. Tools like [json-csv.com](https://json-csv.com) or Python’s `pandas` with `json_normalize()` can flatten nested structures like arrays or objects.

Then your CSV might look like:

```csv
open.all[0],open.all[1],open.all[2]
imap://.../INBOX,mailbox://.../Trash,mailbox://.../Unsent Messages
```

Much more readable.

#### 🔹 Option 2: Use a Better JSON-to-CSV Tool

Try one of these:

* **Online tools**:

  * [https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm](https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm)
  * [https://json-csv.com](https://json-csv.com)

* **VS Code extensions**:

  * Use [Excel Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrapeCity.gc-excelviewer) to view CSVs more easily
  * Try alternatives like “JSON Tools” or “JSON Converter”

* **Command line (Node.js)**:

  ```bash
  npx json2csv -i input.json -o output.csv
  ```

#### 🔹 Option 3: Manually clean up the CSV

If your file only has a few entries, you could:

1. Copy the stringified array into a JSON beautifier (like [jsonformatter.org](https://jsonformatter.org))
2. Expand it into separate rows or columns
3. Paste that back into your CSV

If you upload or paste the **original JSON**, I can show you exactly how to flatten it or even give you a properly formatted CSV version.
