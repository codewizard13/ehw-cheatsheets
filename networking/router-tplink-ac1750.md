## How to Factory Reset?

For the Archer TP-Link AC1750 router all you need to do to factory reset is ***press and hold the button marked "WPS/Reset" on the back for 6 to 10 seconds*** (on some models the button is recessed, so use a paperclip to depress). Release the reset button and wait for the device to reboot. If you can see all the lights flashing, then go off and some lights go back on slowly during the process, that means the device has been reset successfully.

After successfully resetting the router, the default SSIDs (listed on the underside label) should be visible in the available wifi networks list. On Windows 10 it looks like this:

Click to connect to the network that starts with "TP-LINK_..." (there may be two - ignore the 5G on for now). Don't worry if it says "No Internet, secured".

Now, you should be able to navigate to [tplinkwifi.net](tplinkwifi.net) (or you may have better luck with the IP [http://192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1)) and see a login screen like this:

The **default user name and password** is: **admin**. Use that to login and now you can manage your router settings.
