# LocalWP: Without WordPress

####  [[This is a stub]]

[üèöÔ∏è](../README.md) | [How To](/how-to/index.md)

**Q:** How can I use Local by Flywheel / LocalWP with a non-WordPress site?

Although you may use WordPress for absolutely everything, there may be occasions where you break away from the CMS for one reason or another. And if [Local](https://torquemag.io/2020/05/how-to-use-local-by-flywheel/) is your tool of choice for offline development, you might think you have to switch to a different one because you can‚Äôt use it without WordPress.

Thankfully, that‚Äôs not the case.¬†

Today, we‚Äôll show you how to set up and use Local to without WordPress. We‚Äôll discuss what other types of sites you can build with Local, how to access the files and database you need to do it, how to save this non-WordPress site as a blueprint for future use, and suggest some other tools to get the job done.¬†

Enough introduction. Let‚Äôs get to it.¬†

**What Kind of (Non-WordPress) Websites Can You Set Up in Local?**
------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though Local is primarily a [tool for WordPress development](https://torquemag.io/2015/05/wordpress-development-tools/), what you need to understand is that, in the end, it simply simulates a server on your computer. As a consequence, you can also use it to power other software that needs a server to run, such as:

*   **Other PHP-based CMS such as Joomla or Drupal.** These are especially suitable because, like WordPress, they work with a database in the background.
*   **Ecommerce solutions**. You also have a lot of shopping carts and shop systems that need a server and database to run.
*   **Forum software**. This type often works similarly to CMS.
*   **Static HTML or PHP websites.** Here, the page content is included within the files themselves instead of being pulled from a database. You also need to edit the files directly in order to make changes to it.

You can experiment with other web-based software, however, these are probably the main ways you would use Local without WordPress.

All good? Then let‚Äôs talk about the how-to part.

The **Basic Setup for Using Local Without WordPress**
-----------------------------------------------------

To use Local with non-WordPress websites, the basic steps are relatively simple: Create a new site in Local, then delete all its WordPress-related files. You can keep the database, but you will need to delete the tables within it as well.

To make this process more then theoretical, as an example, below I will attempt to install and run a Joomla website inside Local. Let‚Äôs see how I fare.

### 1\. **How to Set up a New Site in Local**

Setting up a new website to, ultimately, use without WordPress in Local is very easy. Simply click the big plus symbol in the lower left corner and follow the instructions.

[![create a new site to use without wordpress in local wp](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-git-test-site-in-local-1024x603.jpg)

![create a new site to use without wordpress in local wp](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-git-test-site-in-local-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-git-test-site-in-local.jpg)

Choose to create a new site and input a name. If you have specific reasons for doing so, you can also define a custom local domain and site path on the hard drive under _Advanced options_.

[![create new site in local to use without wordpress](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-new-site-in-local-to-use-without-wordpress-1024x603.jpg)

![create new site in local to use without wordpress](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-new-site-in-local-to-use-without-wordpress-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-new-site-in-local-to-use-without-wordpress.jpg)

Then, set up your environment, meaning the [PHP version](https://torquemag.io/2018/01/update-php-version-wordpress/), server type, and version of MySQL you are going to use.

[![choose environment for non wordpress local site](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/choose-environment-for-non-wordpress-local-site-1024x603.jpg)

![choose environment for non wordpress local site](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/choose-environment-for-non-wordpress-local-site-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/choose-environment-for-non-wordpress-local-site.jpg)

Again, if you have specific needs here, make sure to adapt these settings to them. In my case, I make sure that the environment meets the [technical requirements of Joomla](https://downloads.joomla.org/technical-requirements).

[![joomla system requirements](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/joomla-system-requirements-1024x470.jpg)

![joomla system requirements](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/joomla-system-requirements-1024x470.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/joomla-system-requirements.jpg)

One thing that‚Äôs important to note is that using the _Preferred_ environment comes with the requirement to use `index.php` for your main file. Therefore, be careful if you are planning to use `index.html` or `index.htm`.¬†In that case, make sure to set the environment to _Custom_ and make your choices. You should also know that you can still [change the server type and PHP version](https://torquemag.io/2022/05/local-features/) later.

In the last step, you have to define your WordPress username and password. Since you are not going to use WordPress, this doesn‚Äôt really matter. Input whatever you want and then click _Add Site_ to finish.

[![configure wordpress credentials](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/configure-wordpress-credentials-1024x603.jpg)

![configure wordpress credentials](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/configure-wordpress-credentials-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/configure-wordpress-credentials.jpg)

### 2\. **Where (and How) to Store Files for Your Non-WordPress Site**

Now that your soon-to-be-non-WordPress site exists, it‚Äôs time to get rid of all those things you don‚Äôt need, meaning the WordPress file system. You can most easily access it via the _Go to site folder_ button under the site‚Äôs name.

[![go to site folder of non wordpress local site](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/go-to-site-folder-of-non-wordpress-local-site-1024x603.jpg)

![go to site folder of non wordpress local site](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/go-to-site-folder-of-non-wordpress-local-site-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/go-to-site-folder-of-non-wordpress-local-site.jpg)

Clicking it will automatically open the directory on your local machine.

[![local website files](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-website-files-1024x603.jpg)

![local website files](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-website-files-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-website-files.jpg)

The files you are looking for are located under _app/public_. If you open it, you can see that it contains all the usual WordPress files.

[![local wordpress files on hard drive](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-wordpress-files-on-hard-drive.jpg)

![local wordpress files on hard drive](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-wordpress-files-on-hard-drive.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-wordpress-files-on-hard-drive.jpg)

Since we are not going to be using WordPress, we can mark everything here and then delete it. After that, you can place whatever non-WordPress files in here. In the case of this example, that‚Äôs the files I [downloaded from Joomla.org](https://downloads.joomla.org/).

[![copy joomla files to localwp directory](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copy-joomla-files-to-localwp-directory.jpg)

![copy joomla files to localwp directory](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copy-joomla-files-to-localwp-directory.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copy-joomla-files-to-localwp-directory.jpg)

### 3\. **Where (and How) to Access the Database and How to Customize It**

Next up is the database. Every site you set up in Local automatically comes with it‚Äôs own. The easiest way to access it is to go to the _Database_ tab in your active site and click _Open Adminer_.

[![open adminer from local database menu](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/open-adminer-from-local-database-menu-1024x604.jpg)

![open adminer from local database menu](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/open-adminer-from-local-database-menu-1024x604.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/open-adminer-from-local-database-menu.jpg)

This will open up a database management tool where you can create databases, tables, and views, run SQL commands, analyze, optimize, and repair database tables, and more. If you have ever used [phpMyAdmin](https://torquemag.io/2015/01/how-to-use-phpmyadmin-wordpress-database/), it should all be relatively straightforward.

[![local adminer](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-adminer-1024x563.jpg)

![local adminer](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-adminer-1024x563.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/local-adminer.jpg)

In this case, we simply want to mark all the tables and then click _Drop_, since we want to use this Local site without anything WordPress-related.

[![drop wordpress tables in adminer](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drop-wordpress-tables-in-adminer.jpg)

![drop wordpress tables in adminer](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drop-wordpress-tables-in-adminer.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drop-wordpress-tables-in-adminer.jpg)

One important note for when you use a CMS that needs a database connection like Joomla: In those cases you will usually need to provide a database name, username, password, and sometimes host name during installation. In Local, by default, these are `local`, `root`, `root`, and `localhost` respectively. However, you can also use the Adminer interface to create your own database and credentials.

Armed with this information, I can now start installing my non-WordPress website. I simply click _Open site_ inside the site view in Local.

[![open site to install non wordpress website in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/open-site-to-install-non-wordpress-website-in-local-1024x604.jpg)

![open site to install non wordpress website in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/open-site-to-install-non-wordpress-website-in-local-1024x604.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/open-site-to-install-non-wordpress-website-in-local.jpg)

In my case, this automatically starts the Joomla setup process that I can simply follow and where I can fill in the database credentials as mentioned above.

[![joomla installer database configuration](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/joomla-installer-database-configuration.jpg)

![joomla installer database configuration](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/joomla-installer-database-configuration.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/joomla-installer-database-configuration.jpg)

One important note here, however, is that for Joomla to connect to the database in LocalWP, I also needed to include the server port. That means something like `localhost:10016` as the hostname instead of just `localhost`. You can find the port number in the _Database_ section as well.

[![database host port number in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/database-host-port-number-in-local-1024x604.jpg)

![database host port number in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/database-host-port-number-in-local-1024x604.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/database-host-port-number-in-local.jpg)

Once that is done and the installation process has finished, I can access my Joomla website via the URL that Local provides.

**How to Save Your Non-WordPress Site as a Blueprint**
------------------------------------------------------

If you anticipate needing to use a non-WordPress site setup more than once within Local, it‚Äôs a really good idea to create a Blueprint out of it.

A Blueprint is essentially a template you can use to create a new site without having to adjust all your settings from scratch. So once you go through the process of deleting the WordPress files and such as described above, you won‚Äôt have to do it again because the Blueprint will contain these specifications for you already.¬†

To create one for your non-WordPress site in Local, simply right-click it in the list and choose _Save as blueprint_ (the site has to be started for that). Give it a name and save.

[![save non wordpress site as blueprint](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/save-non-wordpress-site-as-blueprint-1024x603.jpg)

![save non wordpress site as blueprint](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/save-non-wordpress-site-as-blueprint-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/save-non-wordpress-site-as-blueprint.jpg)

Next time you need similar site for a new project, when you create a new website in Local, pick the option _Create from a Blueprint_ at the beginning.

[![create site from blueprint in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-site-from-blueprint-in-local-1024x603.jpg)

![create site from blueprint in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-site-from-blueprint-in-local-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/create-site-from-blueprint-in-local.jpg)

In the next screen, simply choose your saved blueprint and continue the usual process.

[![choose non wordpress blueprint for new local site](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/choose-non-wordpress-blueprint-for-new-local-site-1024x603.jpg)

![choose non wordpress blueprint for new local site](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/choose-non-wordpress-blueprint-for-new-local-site-1024x603.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/choose-non-wordpress-blueprint-for-new-local-site.jpg)

Once it‚Äôs done, and you open the folder of the new site, you will see that it contains the same non-WordPress files as the original. That‚Äôs all there is to it. Remarkably easy, huh?¬†

You can also rename your Blueprints and delete them at any time by going to the _Blueprints_ menu.

[![blueprints menu in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blueprints-menu-in-local-1024x603.jpg)

![blueprints menu in local](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blueprints-menu-in-local-1024x603.jpg)

Use the three-dot icons on the right change the name of your blueprints or get rid of them if you want.

**Pros and Cons of Setting Up Local Without WordPress**
-------------------------------------------------------

Now that you know how to set up Local without WordPress, let‚Äôs review a few reasons why you might choose to do this or opt for another solution altogether. Let‚Äôs evaluate the pros and cons of this method.¬†

### Pros¬†

*   **Convenience.** If the majority of your website development takes place in WordPress and Local, it‚Äôs simply more convenient to perform this workaround once, save it as a Blueprint, and reuse it whenever the odd occasion strikes that you need a non-WordPress site.¬†
*   **Fast.** Site setup in Local is quick and easy. Creating a Blueprint for a non-WordPress site means that after the initial setup, you can perform this setup equally as fast.¬†
*   **Centralized tools.** Having all your web development tools in one place ‚Äì Local ‚Äì means learning just one platform instead of several.¬†
*   **Get to use Local.** Many people really enjoy the look and user-experience of Local, so it‚Äôs nice to keep your workflow streamlined in this way.¬†

### Cons

*   **Needs extra steps.** Creating a non-WordPress site in Local does require more work, which can be off-putting.¬†
*   **It‚Äôs a bit complicated.** The additional steps are a little bit fiddly and require careful attention to detail. It‚Äôs not nearly as ‚Äúopen-and-go‚Äù as WordPress site creation is.¬†
*   **Other tools can do the job quicker.** Many other local development tools exist that work with non-WordPress sites straight out of the gate, with no extra steps required.¬†

**Alternative Tools to Consider for Non-WordPress Local Development**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you decide to use a different tool other than Local for building non-WordPress sites, you‚Äôre in luck. There are several alternatives available that offer this ability as a default feature. Here are just a few.¬†

### [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

[![xampp logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20230%20232'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![xampp logo](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/xampp-logo.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/xampp-logo.jpg)

First up, we have XAMPP, which is widely regarded as the most popular PHP development environment currently available. It‚Äôs totally free, [easy to install](https://torquemag.io/2015/11/install-wordpress-locally-xampp-windows-mac/) and offers wide-ranging functionality. It includes PHP, Perl, and MariaDB. You can use it to set up non-WordPress and WordPress sites alike, with minimal fuss and effort.¬†

### [EasyPHP](https://www.easyphp.org)

[![easyphp devserver logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20230%20230'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![easyphp devserver logo](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/easyphp-devserver-logo.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/easyphp-devserver-logo.jpg)

Another option comes from EasyPHP, specifically in the form of Devserver. Devsrever is another straightforward-to-use development environment that offers a convenient way to set up new websites on-the-go. You can use it to create a local server for any type of website you wish and take it with you anywhere via external hard drive. It features a tool range that‚Äôs suitable for beginners and experts. Plus, Devserver is modular, so you can add applications to it, access files and folders directly, and much more.¬†

### [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/)

[![mamp logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20230%20230'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![mamp logo](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mamp-logo.jpg)

](https://torquemag.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mamp-logo.jpg)

Lastly, there‚Äôs MAMP, which is another local development environment that‚Äôs totally free to download and use. It‚Äôs available for both Windows and Mac and comes with all the tools you need to run a local server on your computer. It can also be used in conjunction with NAMO to test websites and apps on mobile devices. MAMP is compatible with MySQL, Apache, Nginx, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and Python, too.¬†

**Final Thoughts: Local and Non-WordPress Websites**
----------------------------------------------------

Creating a new WordPress website with Local is an easy process ‚Äì but you know that already. What you might not have known is that you can use Local to create non-WordPress websites, too. And that‚Äôs a real benefit if you wish to keep all your development projects contained within one environment.¬†

Though not a solution for every developer, having this option on the table should bring peace of mind to some who wish to create a unified workflow.¬†

_Do you use Local to develop non-WordPress sites, too? What has you experience been like? We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts below._
