# Bash: How to Add a Newline Character to End of File

[HOME](../README.md) | [How To](/how-to/index.md)

A newline or line-feed character is commonly represented as "\n" in many C-based programming languages. Use the **[echo](/shell/echo.md)** command to append a newline character to the end of a file:

    echo >> path/file.ext

For example, to add a newline to the end of the coding/markdown.md file, use this command:

    echo >> coding/markdown.md
