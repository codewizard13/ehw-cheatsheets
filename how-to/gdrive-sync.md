- Download Google Desktop
- Click on Backup and Sync in system tray
- Sign into Google account

### My Laptop

In this screen we choose the folders to continously backup to Gdrive

**Photo and video upload size:**

!!! #GOTCHA: High quality is a reduced file size, whereas Original Quality is large, full resolution

!!! #TIP: Do quality control here by only choosing the folders you want backed up continuously

**Choose File Types [to backup]**:

- Backup all files and folders
- Backup photos and videos
  - Backup screenshots
  - Backup RAW files

!!! #TERM: Gray Checked - Where a checkbox is checked, but doesn't take effect unless a parent/ancestor is also selected


**Advanced settings:**

- **Ignore files with these extensions:** Add whatever you want here (e.g., WAV, .MACOS, etc.)

!!! #GOTCHA: Uncheck the 'Sync My Drive to this computer' to stop syncing to your laptop
