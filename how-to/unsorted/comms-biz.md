## üìå Overview

Perfect ‚Äî thanks for the context. Based on that, here's a **more casual and natural-sounding version** of your email that smoothly incorporates the idea that Todd (and the team) might benefit too, without overstating it.

**Subject:** Request for Boot.dev Subscription ‚Äì Backend Skills Development

Hi \[Boss's Name],

I‚Äôd like to request a yearly subscription to **Boot.dev** (\$348/year per user for team plans, with discounts for 3+ users). It‚Äôs a hands-on, gamified platform focused on backend technologies like **Python, TypeScript, SQL, Docker, and CI/CD**‚Äîwhich makes the learning process more engaging and easier to retain.

Unlike passive video platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Boot.dev emphasizes real-time coding and structured, skill-building paths. It‚Äôs tailored specifically for backend development‚Äîexactly the kind of tooling and architecture **Todd mentioned** when talking through ideas for the next iteration of **OUR-SITE** (like moving away from WordPress and incorporating TypeScript, Docker, etc.).

The main value for now would be helping me level up in those areas and get more in sync with the direction we‚Äôre heading. That said, with team pricing and just the two of us on dev right now, it could be a useful resource for Todd as well‚Äîespecially since he's always looking to explore new tools and approaches.

Happy to share more or demo the platform if helpful.

Best,
\[Your Name]

Let me know if you want to tighten it even further or tailor it for a specific tone (e.g., more enthusiastic, more neutral, etc.).
