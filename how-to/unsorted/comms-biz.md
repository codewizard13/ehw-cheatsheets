## üìù Purchase Request Email Examples

### Sample 1: Request for Boot.dev Subscription

```
Subject: Request for Boot.dev Yearly Subscription ‚Äì Hands-On Learning Advantage

Hi [Boss's Name],

I‚Äôd like to request a yearly subscription to **Boot.dev** ($348/year per user for team plans, with discounts for 3+ users). It‚Äôs a hands-on platform focused on backend development using Python, TypeScript, SQL, Docker, and CI/CD‚Äîall highly relevant to our work.

Compared to LinkedIn Learning, Boot.dev is far more interactive. Instead of passive videos, it offers structured, project-based learning with real-time coding. The Backend Developer Track includes:

- 16 courses: Python, Git, OOP, Functional Programming, Data Structures, TypeScript, SQL, HTTP, Docker, CI/CD, and more.
- 8 projects: Build a Pokedex, AI Agent, Static Site Generator, Blog Aggregator, and a final Capstone.

These projects help reinforce skills and create a tangible portfolio‚Äîsomething LinkedIn Learning doesn't offer.

I believe this will be a high-ROI investment in deeper technical growth. Happy to discuss or demo if needed.

Best,  
[Your Name]
```

### Sample 2: Alternative Purchase Justification

```
Subject: PURCHASE REQUEST for Boot.dev Subscription ‚Äì Backend Skills Development

Hi [Boss's Name],

I‚Äôd like to request a yearly subscription to **Boot.dev** ($348/year per user for team plans, with discounts for 3+ users). It‚Äôs a hands-on, gamified platform focused on backend technologies like Python, TypeScript, SQL, Docker, and CI/CD‚Äîwhich makes learning more engaging and easier to retain.

Unlike passive video-based platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Boot.dev emphasizes real-time coding and structured, skill-building paths. It‚Äôs specifically geared toward backend development‚Äîmatching our upcoming technology plans.

This subscription would help me level up in these areas and align with our evolving tech stack.

Happy to share more or demo the platform if helpful.

Best,  
[Your Name]
```
