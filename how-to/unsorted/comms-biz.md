## üìå Overview

Perfect ‚Äî thanks for the context. Based on that, here's a **more casual and natural-sounding version** of your email that smoothly incorporates the idea that Todd (and the team) might benefit too, without overstating it.

**Subject:** Request for Boot.dev Subscription ‚Äì Backend Skills Development

Hi \[Boss's Name],

I‚Äôd like to request a yearly subscription to **Boot.dev** (\$348/year per user for team plans, with discounts for 3+ users). It‚Äôs a hands-on, gamified platform focused on backend technologies like **Python, TypeScript, SQL, Docker, and CI/CD**‚Äîwhich makes the learning process more engaging and easier to retain.

Unlike passive video platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Boot.dev emphasizes real-time coding and structured, skill-building paths. It‚Äôs tailored specifically for backend development‚Äîexactly the kind of tooling and architecture **Todd mentioned** when talking through ideas for the next iteration of **OUR-SITE** (like moving away from WordPress and incorporating TypeScript, Docker, etc.).

The main value for now would be helping me level up in those areas and get more in sync with the direction we‚Äôre heading. That said, with team pricing and just the two of us on dev right now, it could be a useful resource for Todd as well‚Äîespecially since he's always looking to explore new tools and approaches.

Happy to share more or demo the platform if helpful.

Best,
\[Your Name]

**Resolution Statement:**

The issue with email delivery failures from `elijahstreams.com`‚Äîspecifically messages being blocked by Gmail due to failed SPF authentication‚Äîwas resolved by updating the domain's SPF record. After consulting with IONOS support, it was confirmed that the existing SPF record was misconfigured. The record was corrected by removing unnecessary includes and replacing the old entry:

```
v=spf1 include:zoho.com include:_spf.perfora.net include:_spf-us.ionos.com include:_spf.kundenserver.de ~all
```

with the simplified and accurate version:

```
v=spf1 include:_spf.perfora.net include:_spf.kundenserver.de -all
```

This change was made via Cloudflare DNS management. The updated record properly authenticates the sending IPs used by IONOS, aligning with Gmail‚Äôs requirements. Propagation was expected to take up to an hour, after which email functionality was tested and confirmed to be working.

**Subject:** Request for Boot.dev Yearly Subscription ‚Äì Hands-On Learning Advantage

Dear \[Boss's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I‚Äôd like to request approval for a yearly subscription to **Boot.dev**, a platform focused on backend development and computer science fundamentals through hands-on coding.

While we currently have access to platforms like LinkedIn Learning, I believe Boot.dev offers a significantly more **practical and immersive learning experience**, particularly for developing deeper technical skills. Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Hands-On, Interactive Learning**
   Unlike many video-based platforms, Boot.dev emphasizes learning by doing. It uses real-time coding exercises and projects that simulate actual development work, which helps reinforce concepts much more effectively than passive video watching.

2. **Backend-Focused Curriculum**
   The curriculum is tailored specifically for backend development (Go, Python, JavaScript, Data Structures, Algorithms), which aligns with the skills I‚Äôm aiming to strengthen. This specialization is more relevant to our team's goals and tech stack than the broader, more generalized content found on LinkedIn Learning.

3. **Structured, Project-Based Progression**
   Boot.dev offers a clear, structured path with built-in assessments and real-world projects. This makes it easier to track progress and apply newly learned skills immediately to work-related tasks or internal tools.

4. **Better ROI for Deep Technical Growth**
   While LinkedIn Learning is a great resource for soft skills and introductory overviews, Boot.dev is better suited for **developing practical, job-ready programming skills**‚Äîwhich I believe will result in a stronger ROI in terms of productivity and long-term capability.

The annual subscription cost is \[insert amount], and I believe it would be a valuable investment in my continued growth and in enhancing our team's technical capacity.

Please let me know if you need more details or would like to see a demo of the platform. I‚Äôd be happy to provide more info or explore a short trial first if that‚Äôs preferable.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
