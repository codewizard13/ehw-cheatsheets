## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Download & Install LocalWP

- Download from [LocalWP official site](https://localwp.com) for your platform.

- On Linux (e.g. Fedora), ensure dependencies like `libxcrypt-compat` are installed.

### 2. Create Your First WordPress Site

- Launch LocalWP and click ‚ÄúCreate a new site‚Äù.
- Name your site (determines your `.local` domain).
- Choose environment: ‚ÄúPreferred‚Äù (default) or ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù for specific PHP/MySQL/Apache versions.
- Set WordPress admin credentials; optionally enable multisite.
- Add site ‚Äî LocalWP automates SSL, host entries, and site launch.

### 3. Verify and Access Site

- Use LocalWP UI ‚ÄúStart Site‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù buttons.
- Trust SSL certificates via UI for HTTPS access.

### 4. Key Features to Use

| Feature                            | Benefit                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Image Optimizer & Link Checker** | Built-in tools for site maintenance tasks.                       |
| **Adminer**                        | Lightweight database GUI alternative to phpMyAdmin.              |
| **Xdebug Support**                 | Integrated debugging with breakpoints configurable in VS Code.   |

### 5. Integrate VS Code

- Open site‚Äôs public folder in VS Code via LocalWP‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen in‚Ä¶‚Äù menu.
- Configure PHP/Composer paths if VS Code reports missing executables.
- Set up debugging via `launch.json` (PHP Debug extension).
- Use terminal for WP-CLI commands through Local‚Äôs shell or VS Code terminal integration.

### 6. Optional Advanced Workflows
