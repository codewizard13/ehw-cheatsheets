## üìå Overview

This guide provides a structured way of creating **Conventional Commit messages** directly from Git diffs or recent file changes. It is especially useful when reviewing pull requests, conducting code reviews, or standardizing commit formats in collaborative projects.  

The template below was originally designed as an **AI-friendly commit prompt**, but it works equally well as a manual checklist for developers.

## üîß Usage Workflow

1. **Review the Diff**  
   Look over the file diffs to understand what code or documentation changed.  

2. **Summarize the Changes**  
   Capture a concise record of what was modified: *functions, logic updates, feature additions, dependency changes, etc.*  

3. **Speculate the Intent**  
   Why were these changes likely made? Common reasons:  
   - Bug fix  
   - New feature  
   - Refactor  
   - Performance optimization  
   - Modernization  

4. **Draft the Commit Message**  
   Follow Conventional Commit structure:  
   - **Type:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, etc.  
   - **Scope:** based on module/file (e.g., `auth-service`, `user-ui`).  
   - **Summary Line:** concise and descriptive.  
   - **Details:** bullet points of each granular change.  
   - **Optional:** ‚ÄúBREAKING CHANGE‚Äù section if something is incompatible.
