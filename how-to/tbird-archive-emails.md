To archive your Google Account folders in Thunderbird while preserving the structure, content, tags, and labels, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Local Folder structure:
   - Right-click on "Local Folders"
   - Select "New Folder"
   - Name it "[gmail_account]_[YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS]" (e.g., "myemail@gmail.com_2024-10-09_143000")

2. Export your Google Account folders:
   - Right-click on your Google Account in the folder pane
   - Select "ImportExportTools NG" > "Export all folders"
   - Choose "EML format"
   - Select the newly created folder under Local Folders as the destination

3. Preserve tags and labels:
   - In Thunderbird's main menu, go to "Tools" > "ImportExportTools NG" > "Export tags/flags"
   - Select your Google Account
   - Choose the newly created local folder as the destination

4. Move the archived folder to the external USB SSD:
   - Close Thunderbird
   - Locate your Thunderbird profile folder
   - Find the "Local Folders" directory
   - Copy the newly created archive folder to your external USB SSD

5. Reopen Thunderbird and verify the archived folders

To organize Local Folders effectively:

1. Use the "Folder Properties" feature:
   - Right-click on a folder
   - Select "Properties"
   - Add descriptions or notes to help identify folder contents

2. Create saved searches:
   - Click "File" > "New" > "Saved Search"
   - Set up search criteria to find specific emails across multiple folders

3. Use the "Folder Pane" view options:
   - Right-click the column headers in the folder pane
   - Select "Folder" and "Total" to see message counts

4. Consider the "Folder Sizes" add-on:
   - Install it from Thunderbird's Add-ons Manager
   - Use it to visualize folder sizes and manage storage

By following these steps, you'll create a comprehensive archive of your Google Account folders while preserving tags and labels. The suggested organization methods will help you manage your Local Folders effectively[1][2][3][4][5].
