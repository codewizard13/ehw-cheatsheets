####  [[This is a stub]]

[🏚️](../README.md) | [How To](/how-to/index.md)

This is a list of examples of different regexes (**regular expressions**) I find useful.

### Notepad++

REPLACE tab dialog settings enabled:

- Wraparound
- Regular expression

#### Convert WordPress "plugins to be updated" list to a minimized bullet list

**Search:**

    ^(.*?)\r\nYou have version (.*?) installed. Update to (.*?). View (.*?)\.\r\nCompatibility with (.*)

**Replace:**

    - \1: \2 -> \3


Follow that up with,

    ^select.*$

And replace that with nothing. Then do the same for this pattern:

    ^Compatibility.*$


**Example Output**

If you start with something like this (after copying from WordPress admin Plugins page to NPP),

    Select Elementor	

    Elementor
    You have version 3.21.5 installed. Update to 3.21.6. View version 3.21.6 details.
    Compatibility with WordPress 6.5.3: 100% (according to its author)

    Select Elementor Pro	

    Elementor Pro
    You have version 3.21.2 installed. Update to 3.21.3. View version 3.21.3 details.
    Compatibility with WordPress 6.5.3: 100% (according to its author)

    Select Unlimited Elements for Elementor	

    Unlimited Elements for Elementor
    You have version 1.5.106 installed. Update to 1.5.107. View version 1.5.107 details.
    Compatibility with WordPress 6.5.3: 100% (according to its author)

Then run **Edit > Line Operations > Remove Duplicate Lines**

The result will be something like this:

    Elementor: 3.21.5 -> 3.21.6
    Elementor Pro: 3.21.2 -> 3.21.3
    Unlimited Elements for Elementor: 1.5.106 -> 1.5.107
