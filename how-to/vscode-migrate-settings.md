# VSCODE: How to Migrate Settings to Another Computer?

####  [[This is a stub]]

[🏚️](../README.md) | [How To](/how-to/index.md)

There are two ways you can migrate **[VSCODE](/coding/vscode.md)** settings to another computer:

1. Manually copy everything over
2. Export / Import Profile


## Manually copy everything over

## Export Profile

- File > Preferences > Profiles (Default) > Export Profile
- Click "Export" button at bottom left
- Enter a file name to save as
- Chose to save as a local file (the GitHub option is a bit confusing)

## Import Profile

- File > Preferences > Profiles (Default) > Import Profile
- Click "Select File" in the dropdown
- Select a .code-profile file
- Click "Create Profile" button in lower left to confirm

!!! #GOTCHA: You must click "Create Profile" or your extensions won't be installed.
