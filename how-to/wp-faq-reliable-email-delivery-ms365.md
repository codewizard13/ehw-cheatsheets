## üìå Overview

**Microsoft 365 has deprecated Basic Authentication for SMTP as of October 1, 2025, making OAuth 2.0 mandatory for all email authentication and delivery.** This FAQ addendum provides detailed answers for configuring the [WP Mail SMTP](https://wpmailsmtp.com) Pro plugin with Microsoft 365 using OAuth through Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).[1][3]

**WP Mail SMTP Pro is the most reliable and future-proof solution for WordPress email integration with Microsoft 365 Exchange Online.** It supports both simplified One-Click setup and manual Azure app registration for advanced control. This FAQ complements setup guides with clarifications, troubleshooting, and security best practices in line with Microsoft's 2025 policies.[5]

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Configuration Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Azure Active Directory the right platform for registration?</strong></summary>
Yes. Microsoft 365 uses Azure Active Directory (now Azure Entra ID) as its OAuth identity provider. Even though emails are sent through Exchange Online SMTP, all OAuth app registrations and permission management occur in the Azure portal.[1]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I continue using Ionos SMTP with Microsoft 365?</strong></summary>
While temporarily possible, using Ionos SMTP relying on Basic Authentication is not recommended. Microsoft is phasing out Basic Authentication and will fully disable it by April 2026. Switching to OAuth 2.0 with WP Mail SMTP Pro is recommended for compliance and reliability.[1]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What prerequisites are required for WP Mail SMTP with Microsoft 365?</strong></summary>
Requirements include an SSL-enabled WordPress site, a licensed Microsoft 365 mailbox, admin access to Azure AD for app registration, and a valid WP Mail SMTP Pro license.[3][5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use the One-Click Setup method?</strong></summary>
Yes. WP Mail SMTP Pro version 4.3+ supports One-Click Setup to automatically configure OAuth with your Microsoft account, which simplifies setup without manual Azure registration, requiring SSL and a Pro license.[3][5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is manual Azure app registration necessary?</strong></summary>
Manual registration is optional but recommended for organizations needing control over app permissions or multiple sites. It involves creating an app in Azure, generating client secrets, granting Microsoft Graph permissions, and entering credentials in WP Mail SMTP.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I ensure continued access after password or security changes?</strong></summary>
If password or MFA settings change, you must remove the existing OAuth connection in WP Mail SMTP settings and re-authorize the connection to maintain email sending capability.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What SMTP servers does WP Mail SMTP's Microsoft 365 mailer use?</strong></summary>
It uses `smtp.office365.com` for SMTP envelope email sending internally but leverages OAuth tokens obtained via Azure AD to authenticate securely, avoiding traditional password authentication.[4][7]
</details>

### Licensing and Costs

<details>
<summary><strong>What license level is required for Microsoft 365 mailer?</strong></summary>
WP Mail SMTP requires at least the Basic Pro license ($99/year) to activate the Microsoft 365 / Outlook mailer with OAuth support. The free version lacks OAuth capabilities.[3]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are there extra Microsoft 365 fees?</strong></summary>
No additional fees apply beyond your existing Microsoft 365 mailbox licensing. Azure app registration and use of Microsoft Exchange Online SMTP are included in standard subscriptions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can shared mailboxes be used for sending?</strong></summary>
Yes, if the authenticated Microsoft user has Send As permissions on the shared mailbox. WP Mail SMTP settings must reflect the appropriate From Email address configured accordingly.
</details>

### Security and Authentication

<details>
<summary><strong>Does WP Mail SMTP support multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</strong></summary>
Yes. MFA works seamlessly with OAuth. If enabled after initial setup, you must re-authorize WP Mail SMTP to maintain OAuth access.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How secure is OAuth compared to Basic Authentication?</strong></summary>
OAuth uses token-based authentication, eliminating password storage within WordPress, supporting token refresh, and granting granular permission scopes, enhancing security over legacy Basic Authentication.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I handle OAuth token expiration?</strong></summary>
Tokens expire periodically. WP Mail SMTP prompts to reconnect by removing and re-authorizing the Microsoft connection to refresh OAuth tokens.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I customize the From Name in emails?</strong></summary>
No. Microsoft 365 mailer uses the authenticated account's display name for the From Name and does not support overriding this setting for security reasons.[5]
</details>

### Technical Limitations

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the maximum email size WP Mail SMTP supports with Microsoft 365?</strong></summary>
Email size limits typically align with Microsoft Exchange mailbox limits. Older plugin versions had 4MB limits, but current versions depend on mailbox policies, usually up to 35MB.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How many emails can I send per minute?</strong></summary>
Microsoft allows up to approximately 1,000 emails per minute via Graph API and SMTP, higher than legacy SMTP limits, supporting high-volume transactional emails.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I send emails on behalf of different users or shared mailboxes?</strong></summary>
Yes, provided appropriate Send As permissions are set in Microsoft 365 and the From Email is configured in WP Mail SMTP accordingly. Your sender name will be fixed to the authenticating account's display name.[5]
</details>

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>What causes the ‚ÄúInvalid state‚Äù OAuth error?</strong></summary>
This occurs if the From Email address does not exactly match the Microsoft account used for OAuth authentication. Ensure these are identical to resolve the error.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to resolve ‚ÄúMailboxNotEnabledForRESTAPI‚Äù?</strong></summary>
This means the mailbox doesn‚Äôt have access to Microsoft Graph API. Use only Microsoft 365 mailboxes (not on-premises Exchange) that support Microsoft Graph for OAuth.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I receive ‚ÄúErrorSendAsDenied‚Äù?</strong></summary>
This error appears if the From Email differs from the OAuth authenticated user without Send As permissions. Grant proper permissions or align From Email to the authenticating account.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if emails suddenly stop sending?</strong></summary>
Common issues include expired WP Mail SMTP license, expired OAuth connection needing re-authorization, or password changes that invalidate tokens. Check plugin status and renew or reconnect as needed.[10][5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Microsoft Government Cloud (GCC) require special configuration?</strong></summary>
Yes, GCC and DoD tenants may require tailored app settings for domain suffixes like `.us` and modified permission scopes for proper OAuth functionality.[5]
</details>

### Best Practices

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I configure a backup email connection?</strong></summary>
While optional, configuring a backup SMTP connection or smart routing in WP Mail SMTP improves email deliverability reliability if the primary Microsoft 365 connection fails.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to maintain ongoing OAuth security?</strong></summary>
Regularly review Azure app permissions, renew client secrets before expiration (maximum 24 months), use conditional access policies if available, and audit usage in Microsoft 365 security logs.[5]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I monitor email deliverability and errors?</strong></summary>
Utilize WP Mail SMTP‚Äôs Email Logging and Failure Alerts Pro features to track sent emails, identify issues timely, and monitor site email health.[1][3]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What should I do about SMTP blocking by firewalls?</strong></summary>
Ensure outbound connections on port 587 (SMTP submission) to `smtp.office365.com` are allowed on your hosting and network firewall to prevent delivery failures.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are there alternatives to WP Mail SMTP for Microsoft 365 integration?</strong></summary>
Yes, alternatives like Fluent SMTP and Post SMTP exist, but WP Mail SMTP Pro offers the most direct official support and frequent updates aligned to Microsoft OAuth changes.
</details>
