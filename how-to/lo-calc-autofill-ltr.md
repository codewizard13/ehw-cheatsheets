According to https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Automatically_Calculating_Series: 170

You can double-click the fill handle to automatically fill all empty columns of the current data block.

However, there is no similar feature for rows. Instead, to fill many cells, do the following:

Go to the cell to autofill from.
Press Ctrl+Shift+End to select the cells to fill.
Fill right by going to Sheet ‚Üí Fill Cells ‚Üí Right (Alt+s, i, r on my machine).
Tools ‚Üí Customize can be used to set up a key combination to fill right.

For only a few cells, simply drag and drop the fill handle instead.
