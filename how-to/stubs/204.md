## What Christian Nationalism Really Is: The Truth from Modern Prophets

*For the curious Christian worker who feels called to serve God — but wonders if politics is off limits*

---

### Christian Nationalism: What It Means According to Modern Prophets

There’s a lot of confusion out there about what **Christian Nationalism** means. Some say it’s dangerous, some say it’s racist, some say it’s anti-Christian. But those voices come mostly from the mainstream media — NPR, *Christianity Today*, and liberal denominations like Methodists who have embraced a theology that departs from biblical truth.

We should instead listen carefully to **the new prophetic voices God has raised up** — especially those regularly heard on ElijahStreams — who have boldly spoken truth in these times. Prophets like **Robin D. Bullock**, **Johnny Enlow**, **Kat Kerr**, **Hank Kunneman**, and **Amanda Grace** have received clear revelations from God about America, President Trump, and the nation’s calling. These prophets have been faithful to uplift the saints, call for repentance, and issue warnings where needed, not with fear but with hope and confidence.

### What These Prophets Say Christian Nationalism Is

* It is **recognizing that God has placed America as a modern Cyrus** — a nation with a divine role to fulfill in the earth (like King David and Cyrus before).
* It means **Christians not abdicating their rightful role in government, law, education, and all “seven mountains” of influence**.
* It means **standing with leaders like President Trump**, whom God anointed for this hour to contend against the forces of darkness and corruption.
* It is **not about domination or oppression, but about reclaiming the spiritual foundations that made this nation great**.

These prophets make clear: Christian Nationalism is about **faithful stewardship of the nation**, prayerful governance, and righteous influence — not the caricatures painted by the media or liberal church leaders.

### Why You Should Trust These Prophets Over the Critics

Mainstream media and liberal Christianity have pushed a narrative designed to silence prophetic voices and confuse believers:

* The **deep state and spiritual darkness control much of the media**, twisting narratives about Christian Nationalism to paint it as hate-filled or racist.
* Even **some “Christian” outlets like *Christianity Today* have sided with political agendas that undermine prophetic revelations** about Trump and the nation.
* Many **left-leaning denominations have departed from biblical standards**, endorsing lifestyles and leadership that contradict Scripture — these voices should not be the measuring stick for truth.

In contrast, the prophets on ElijahStreams have **stood firm**, boldly proclaiming God’s plans despite criticism and attacks. Their words align with Scripture and historic biblical principles of godly government and national destiny.

### Scripture Shows Us We Are Called to Influence Government

The Bible teaches that believers are to be salt and light (Matthew 5:13–16) in **all areas of society**, including government (the “mountain” of influence):

* *“Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD…”* (Psalm 33:12) — nations thrive when they honor God.
* *“Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.”* (Romans 13:1) — God ordains leaders and governments.
* *“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May those who love you be secure.”* (Psalm 122:6) — believers are called to intercede for their nations.
* God anointed King Cyrus (Isaiah 45:1) — a pagan king used to accomplish divine purposes, just as these prophets say Trump is appointed for this moment.

God calls **every generation** to serve Him through the nations where they live — not to abandon this responsibility out of fear or false humility.

---

### What Christian Nationalism Is Not

* It is **not racism or hatred** (though detractors like to claim so).
* It is **not forcing others to believe** but standing for the truth and values that honor God.
* It is **not surrendering to secularism or leftist ideologies** that tear down God’s standards.

---

### How You Can Engage

If you’ve felt reluctant or afraid to engage in government or politics because you thought it was “unspiritual,” **know that God is raising up a new generation of believers to be bold and wise**:

* **Pray for your leaders and nation** (1 Timothy 2:1–2).
* **Speak up for godly values** in your community and workplace.
* **Support leaders who align with biblical truth**, like the prophets say Trump does.
* **Remember that God’s Kingdom is supreme, but He calls us to influence the kingdoms here** (John 18:36).

---

### Final Encouragement

The critics will continue to mislabel and misunderstand Christian Nationalism. But God’s prophetic voices are clear: Christians are called to **take back the ground** in government and culture, to be faithful stewards, and to stand boldly for the truth.

Let us listen to these prophets, pray fervently, and engage courageously — trusting God to bring revival and righteousness to our land.
