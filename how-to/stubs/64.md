# WORDPRESS BACKUP STRATEGIES:


**Prompt**:


VOCAB:  I don't trust mainstream scalable server companies like Amazon, Azure, and Google for cloud-hosting. They are deep state and aligned with both agenda 2030 and 17 UN principles and DEI and Social Credit Score principles which I firmly reject. Aside from my personal opinions, the facts are certain companies have shown their either cowardice or willing unwillingness to refuse intimidation tactics from criminal government actors and private enterprises aligned with the illuminati NWO. Prime example - Parler was hosted on Amazon, trusted Amazon for their hosting, but after some (not much) pressure from leftists and communist politicians in our government, Amazon effectively disabled/killed Parler by shutting down their servers.

Got it — you’re basically expressing deep distrust toward **mainstream cloud hosting providers** like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud because:

* You see them as aligned with government/NGO agendas (Agenda 2030, UN’s 17 principles, DEI/social credit systems).
* They have a proven history of **deplatforming or cutting off service** to companies under political or social pressure (Parler being your key example).
* You believe they either lack courage to resist government intimidation or are directly complicit in the agendas you oppose.

This vocabulary/summary frames your position as:

* **“Mainstream cloud providers are compromised.”**
* **“Reliability and independence are critical.”**
* **“Censorship resistance and sovereignty”** are your priorities.

Would you like me to build you a list of **alternative hosting providers** (ones that market themselves as independent, censorship-resistant, or “non-Big Tech”)?
That would give you some concrete, actionable options that align with your principles.

Yes -that's would be awesome! Validate your answer for today's date

Cool — there **are** some alternatives (especially in the “decentralized / blockchain / peer‑to‑peer / free‑speech friendly” space) that try to avoid central control. None are perfect, so you’ll have trade‑offs. Here’s a curated list (as of October 2025) along with pros, cons, and caveats. Use this as a starting point; always vet them (legal, technical, jurisdiction) before committing.

## Alternative / Less Mainstream Hosting / Cloud / Decentralized Options

Below are providers or platforms that lean toward decentralization, censorship resistance, or smaller-scale control. Some specialize in storage, some in compute, some in mixed services.

| Name                                                                | What they offer / niche                                                                               | Pros (towards your goals)                                                                                                          | Risks / disadvantages / caveats                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Akash Network**                                                   | Decentralized cloud / compute marketplace (containers, etc.) ([PR Newswire][1])                       | Open, permissionless; you can choose providers; lower cost than big clouds in many cases ([PR Newswire][1])                        | Still relatively new / smaller ecosystem; service quality depends on which providers you pick; potential reliability or node stability issues            |
| **Aleph Cloud**                                                     | Decentralized cloud, compute + storage + web hosting / dApp support ([aleph.cloud][2])                | Strong focus on censorship resistance, fragmentation of data, and user sovereignty ([aleph.cloud][2])                              | Must learn their model / token mechanism; performance might not match legacy clouds for certain workloads                                                |
| **P2P Cloud**                                                       | Run websites, apps, databases via distributed node providers and attested enclaves ([p2pcloud.io][3]) | Emphasis on “trustless environment,” transparency about node uptime, secure enclaves ([p2pcloud.io][3])                            | New / experimental; not as battle-tested as big providers; you’ll need comfort with edge cases                                                           |
| **NearlyFreeSpeech.NET**                                            | Traditional web hosting + domain registrar                                                            | They explicitly promote free speech and have a history of resisting takedowns without court orders ([Wikipedia][4])                | Their model is more modest (not a massive global cloud); might not scale for huge compute or GPU workloads                                               |
| **Decentralized Storage Platforms** (Filecoin, Storj, Sia, etc.)    | Storage (not necessarily full compute)                                                                | Split-encrypted storage over nodes removes single point of failure; censorship resistance in file storage ([Developer Updates][5]) | Storage-only (you’ll still need compute / hosting elsewhere); throughput, latency, consistency issues; not all are truly fully decentralized in practice |
| **ZeroNet**                                                         | Peer-to-peer web hosting (websites hosted via P2P) ([Wikipedia][6])                                   | You host your site via a mesh of peers, removing dependence on any single server                                                   | More suitable for static / semi-dynamic sites; less for heavy backend / database needs                                                                   |
| **Decentralized “Web3” / node‑hosting platforms** (e.g. Ankr, Flux) | Node infrastructure, partial compute, bridging traditional & decentralized                            | These aim to replace or complement parts of cloud infrastructure with decentralized components ([Medium][7])                       | Their maturity, service guarantees, or governance might be volatile; check for provider lock-in in their own systems                                     |

---

## Things to Watch Out For / Vet Carefully

* **Jurisdiction & data laws:** Even if a service is decentralized, parts of it may physically reside in countries with strong control regimes or where legal pressure can be applied.
* **Governance & control mechanisms:** Some decentralized networks still have core maintainers, token holders, or “root” nodes that can exert influence.
* **Performance / latency / consistency trade-offs:** Decentralization often has to compromise in one or more dimensions (speed, reliability, consistency).
* **Uptime / SLA guarantees:** Many of these are experimental; their SLAs are weaker or non-existent compared to AWS/Azure/Google.
* **Token / economic dependencies:** Many decentralized clouds use crypto tokens, staking, or payment models that you’ll have to understand and manage.
* **Fallback or hybrid mode:** You might want to use a mix (some workloads on more stable legacy clouds, others on decentralized) in case parts of the decentralized network fail or degrade.

If you like, I can put together a **ranked shortlist** (say top 2–3) *right now* that best match your needs (e.g. for a typical web server + database + storage stack) and include cost comparisons. Would you prefer that?

Thanks for the detailed system info — this gives a very clear picture of your situation and constraints. Here's a refined, **reliable backup architecture and strategy** tailored to your environment:

---

## 🔒 Your Key Priorities

Based on what you've said, your priorities are:

1. **90% of site content is media** (MP3s ~70GB, growing daily)
2. **You *must* self-host** your media — no offloading to S3/Spaces/CDN
3. **Censorship-resistance** is a non-negotiable (must avoid reliance on big tech/cloud platforms that could deplatform)
4. **Money is no object**, but **availability and reliability are critical**
5. **UpdraftPlus is failing**, and the current stack is unable to reliably back up the entire site (~85GB) via plugin-based means

You're in a category where most mainstream backup plugins either:

* **fail silently**
* **choke on media volumes**
* or **aren't built for scale**

We’ll now walk through a **battle-tested backup architecture** designed for your needs.

---

## ✅ TL;DR — Recommended Strategy

| Component                | Solution                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Media stays local**    | Yes — maintain your MP3 files on your server                                                                                                       |
| **Backups**              | Use **restic** or **borg** for server-side, encrypted, deduplicated backups                                                                        |
| **Storage Destinations** | Use **multiple censorship-resistant cloud or private storage options** (e.g. rsync.net, self-hosted SFTP server, B2/Wasabi with private endpoints) |
| **Backup Method**        | Cron-scheduled **filesystem-level incremental backups** + MySQL dump, **not** WordPress plugin                                                     |
| **Plugins**              | Deactivate UpdraftPlus unless needed for DB-only backups                                                                                           |
| **Restore Testing**      | Set up a script to restore to a staging environment or snapshot mount periodically                                                                 |
| **Monitoring**           | Log backups and set up email or webhook alerts on failure                                                                                          |

---

## ⚙️ 1. Use `restic` (or `borg`) for Industrial-Grade Backups

Both [**restic**](https://restic.net/) and [**borgbackup**](https://www.borgbackup.org/) are built for backing up large, growing filesystems.

### ✅ Why restic is a great fit:

* **Snapshot-based**, **incremental**, **deduplicated** backups
* Handles large files (100GB+), even on slow or limited servers
* Can back up directly to:

  * Local disk
  * Remote SFTP
  * rsync.net (censorship-resistant)
  * Backblaze B2
  * Wasabi
  * Self-hosted MinIO or S3-compatible server
* Supports **encryption**, **pruning**, and **retention policies**
* CLI-based, perfect for cron jobs

> **Alternative:** `borg` has better compression and deduplication for local-to-local backups, but `restic` is more flexible for remote/cloud backups.

---

## 🔄 2. Recommended Backup Workflow (Scripted, Not Plugin-Based)

### 📂 Filesystem Layout

From your paths, your WordPress install is here:

```bash
/homepages/31/d177980853/htdocs/es-podcasts
```

With ~70GB in:

```bash
wp-content/uploads/
```

And ~15GB in core WordPress files + themes + plugins

---

### 🧪 Backup Script (Daily Cron)

Install `restic` on your server and schedule something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Config
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY="/backup/restic-repo"           # Can be remote (SFTP, S3, B2, etc.)
export RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE="/root/.restic_pass"

# Exclude cache/temp dirs
EXCLUDES="--exclude=*.tmp --exclude=cache --exclude=*.log"

# Paths to back up
BACKUP_PATHS="/homepages/31/d177980853/htdocs/es-podcasts"

# Dump MySQL (adjust credentials)
DB_DUMP="/tmp/db-backup.sql"
mysqldump -u root -p'YOUR_DB_PASS' --single-transaction --quick --lock-tables=false es_podcasts_db > "$DB_DUMP"

# Run backup
restic backup $EXCLUDES $BACKUP_PATHS $DB_DUMP

# Optional: prune old backups (keep 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly)
restic forget --prune --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 12

# Cleanup
rm "$DB_DUMP"
```

Schedule this with cron (`crontab -e`):

```bash
0 3 * * * /root/scripts/backup-wordpress.sh >> /var/log/wp-backup.log 2>&1
```

---

## ☁️ 3. Reliable, Censorship-Resistant Storage Destinations

To support **censorship resistance** and **availability**, avoid U.S. big tech (Google, AWS, Dropbox). Use:

### ✅ Recommended:

| Destination                                            | Why It Works                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[rsync.net](https://rsync.net/products/rsync.html)** | Fully encrypted, censorship-resistant, SSH-based backup platform. Rock solid uptime, runs `restic`, `rsync`, `borg` natively |
| **Backblaze B2** (with your own encryption key)        | Cheap, S3-compatible, U.S. based but tolerable if encrypted fully                                                            |
| **Wasabi** (if you trust it)                           | No egress fees, good S3-compatible storage, but you must bring your own encryption                                           |
| **Self-hosted SFTP/MinIO server in safe jurisdiction** | Use your own cloud/server in a privacy-respecting country like Iceland, Switzerland, or Finland                              |

Combine **at least two destinations** for redundancy.

---

## 🧪 4. Test Restores

Once a month, run a restore test to:

* Download a backup from your repo
* Unpack to a staging server (or temporary directory)
* Restore the DB
* Validate media and plugin load

You can even automate this to spin up a temporary VPS/container to run tests against.

---

## 🧱 5. Why Plugins Will Continue to Fail

You mentioned:

> “UpdraftPlus backups are unreliable. Full backup sets often fail or are incomplete with many zip parts missing.”

This is 100% expected at 85+ GB:

| Problem                    | Why It Happens                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing ZIP parts          | PHP runs out of time / memory when zipping big media files   |
| Dropbox fails              | Remote API limits, chunked uploads fail, retries not handled |
| Plugin timeouts            | Web-based plugins die silently after 300s PHP limit          |
| No deduplication           | Same files are backed up repeatedly                          |
| Upload retry logic is weak | One part fails, whole backup corrupted                       |

**Conclusion:** **You’ve outgrown plugin-based backups**. This is common once you cross ~20–30 GB.

---

## 🔒 6. Final Recommendation: Your Stack

| Area                     | Tool                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Backup software**      | `restic` (or `borg` if staying local)                                    |
| **Backup schedule**      | Daily full filesystem + DB dump (restic handles incremental diffs)       |
| **Storage destinations** | `rsync.net` + `Backblaze B2` OR `Wasabi` + your own SFTP box             |

## ❓ Want Help Setting This Up?

If you like, I can write you:

* A complete install guide for `restic` on your hosting platform
* Cron-ready scripts for backups and restores
* Rclone config for B2/Wasabi
* A backup audit checklist for your team

Would you like the full **backup setup script** with destination options (rsync.net, SFTP, B2)? Or help configuring a **restore test routine**?

Let me know how deep you want to go — we can get this bulletproof.
