- "Step" headings were H1 - Refactored to H2 including refactoring all other nested heading levels to the next smaller one (H3 -> H4, H2-> H3, etc.)
- horizontal lines should only be used as separators after each H2 level, but nowhere else



Generate a conventional commit message formatted as follows:  
- Use type `docs` unless clearly another type, scope as all affected top-level folders.  
- Summary line ≤70 chars, concise explaining what and why.  
- Group affected files by bolded folder path (e.g., **how-to/github/**).  
- For each file, list only the filename (no folder prefix) inside backticks and bolded.  
- Under each file bullet, add up to 6 concise indented paragraphs, each starting with verbs like Added, Updated, Corrected, describing key changes.  
- Optionally include a separate, last section prefixed with ⚠️ **Gotcha:** for warnings, caveats, or future tasks regarding the changes.  
- Maintain consistent blank lines and indentation for readability.
