**Title:** Configure WordPress to Send Emails via Microsoft 365 SMTP with WP Mail SMTP Pro

**Purpose:** Improve WordPress email reliability by routing messages through Microsoft 365‚Äôs authenticated SMTP.

**Impact if not addressed:** Business emails sent from WordPress (e.g., contact forms, notifications) may continue to be rejected, flagged as spam, or never reach recipients, leading to missed inquiries and reduced customer trust.

**Description:**
WP Mail Logging results show WordPress emails marked as ‚Äúsent,‚Äù but this only confirms handoff by the site, not acceptance or delivery by Microsoft 365. Since migrating from Ionos to Microsoft 365, WordPress is likely still using the PHP `mail()` function, which lacks proper authentication. Microsoft 365 requires authenticated SMTP, and without it, messages risk rejection or poor deliverability due to missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment.

No SMTP plugin has been configured since the WordPress migration in 2023, so mail delivery was likely handled by the host. To align with Microsoft 365 requirements and ensure consistent delivery, we need to configure SMTP properly.

**Next Steps:**

- Install and configure **WP Mail SMTP Pro** for Microsoft 365‚Äôs SMTP service with full authentication.
- Send test messages to verify successful delivery without bounces or spam filtering.
- Review logs to confirm acceptance by Microsoft 365.
- Adjust DNS/SPF/DKIM/DMARC if necessary for maximum alignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- WordPress emails are sent using Microsoft 365 SMTP with authentication.
- Test messages are delivered reliably to recipient inboxes.
- Logs confirm successful handoff and delivery acceptance by Microsoft 365.

üëâ Do you also want me to break this into **subtasks** (plugin install, DNS record checks, testing, monitoring) for easier assignment and tracking in Asana?
