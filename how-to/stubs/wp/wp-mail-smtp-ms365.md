## 📌 Overview

Sending emails reliably from WordPress is critical for business communications such as contact forms, notifications, and transactional emails. By default, WordPress uses the PHP `mail()` function, which has significant limitations impacting email deliverability and security. To optimize email sending, especially in environments using Microsoft 365 email hosting, configuring WordPress to send mail via SMTP is essential.

This article explains the current best practices (as of October 2025) for configuring WordPress email delivery through Microsoft 365 SMTP using the [WP Mail SMTP Pro](https://wpmailsmtp.com) plugin. It covers why traditional methods often fail today, why Ionos SMTP is not recommended, and how WP Mail SMTP Pro helps ensure compliance and reliable delivery in the face of Microsoft's evolving security policies.

***

## 🔧 Why Use SMTP Instead of PHP mail()

- WordPress’s default PHP `mail()` function relies on local server mail transfers without authentication headers, often resulting in emails being marked as spam or dropped.
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) provides authenticated, secure email delivery through established mail servers using protocols like SSL/TLS.
- Sending via SMTP increases inbox placement rates and allows support for rich email features like attachments and HTML formatting.
- Many hosting providers disable or restrict PHP mail to prevent abuse, so SMTP is generally the more reliable option.

***

## ⚠️ Microsoft 365 SMTP Changes in 2025

- As of **September 2025**, Microsoft 365 **deprecated Basic Authentication** for SMTP Client Submission, removing support for simple username/password authentication.
- Microsoft now requires **OAuth 2.0** for all third-party SMTP connections to enhance security and prevent credential theft.
- This change means that legacy SMTP sending setups without OAuth won’t be able to authenticate or relay mail through Microsoft 365 servers.
- Properly configured OAuth 2.0 SMTP connections are required to meet Microsoft’s security and compliance standards.

***

## 🔑 Why Ionos SMTP Is Not Suitable

- Ionos SMTP servers **do not support Microsoft’s OAuth 2.0 authentication flow**, which is mandatory for sending through Microsoft 365 as per 2025 policies.
- Attempting to send mail via Ionos SMTP using username/password authentication bypasses Microsoft’s OAuth requirements, resulting in authentication failures or deliverability issues.
- Using Ionos SMTP may cause SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to fail alignment checks, which are critical for avoiding spam filters and rejections.
- The OAuth support Ionos offers applies only to logging into WordPress admin via Single Sign-On and **does not extend to SMTP email authentication**.
- Consequently, routing WordPress emails through Ionos SMTP undermines Microsoft 365’s secure email sending expectations.

***

## 🛠️ Advantages of WP Mail SMTP Pro

- Enables **direct connection to Microsoft 365 SMTP using OAuth 2.0**, fully compliant with Microsoft’s current security mandates.
- Provides **white-glove setup** options, simplifying configuration and reducing human error risk.
- Includes **email logging and detailed failure alerts**, helping administrators quickly diagnose issues.
- Offers **backup SMTP connections and routing logic** to maximize deliverability and prevent email loss.
- Ensures **priority support** and regular updates compatible with Microsoft and WordPress changes.
- Supports multiple mailers and integrates via third-party APIs for flexible setups.

***

## 📖 Setup Summary

- Install [WP Mail SMTP Pro](https://wpmailsmtp.com) plugin on your WordPress site.
- Use the plugin’s Microsoft 365 mailer option to configure OAuth 2.0 authenticated SMTP sending.
- Configure your Microsoft Azure app registration and grant permissions as prompted to enable OAuth authorization.
- Test email delivery and verify logs to confirm successful delivery.
- If necessary, adjust DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to align with Microsoft 365 servers.
- Leverage backup SMTP mailers within the plugin for improved resilience.
