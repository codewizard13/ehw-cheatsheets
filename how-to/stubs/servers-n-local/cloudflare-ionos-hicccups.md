# üß† KB ARTICLE: Cloudflare Proxy Causing Server ‚ÄúHiccups‚Äù with IONOS Hosting

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Eric L. Hepperle
**Date Created:** 2025-10-28
**AI Assistance:** GPT-5

## üìù Summary

When using **Cloudflare‚Äôs proxy service (‚Äúorange cloud‚Äù mode)** in front of an **IONOS-hosted web server**, users may experience **intermittent connection issues** ‚Äî described as *server hiccups*, dropped sessions, or brief outages.

These symptoms can occur even when DNS and hosting are configured correctly, and tend to affect **streaming, livestreams, or long-duration HTTP/HTTPS connections**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Symptoms

If your domain (e.g., `elijahstreams.com`) is proxied through Cloudflare and hosted on IONOS, you may notice:

| Symptom                                | Frequency    | Typical Duration |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Page partially loads or stalls         | Randomly     | 10‚Äì60 seconds    |
| Livestream disconnects / restarts      | Intermittent | 2‚Äì5 minutes      |
| "Origin unreachable" or 502/504 errors | Occasional   | Temporary        |
| Increased buffering on video streams   | Frequent     | 15‚Äì30 seconds    |
| SSL handshake failures in logs         | Occasional   | Sporadic         |

These interruptions may not occur every day, but often enough to impact reliability for continuous services like **daily livestreams** or **ministry broadcasts**.

---

## üîç Root Cause

### 1. **Proxy Interference with Persistent Connections**

Cloudflare‚Äôs proxy layer optimizes web traffic for short-lived HTTP(S) requests, but it can inadvertently interrupt **long-running TCP sessions**, WebSockets, or **HLS/RTMP livestreams**.

IONOS servers sometimes close idle connections sooner than Cloudflare expects, causing temporary disconnections or handshake resets.

---

### 2. **SSL Handshake & Caching Conflicts**

Cloudflare‚Äôs ‚ÄúFull‚Äù or ‚ÄúFull (Strict)‚Äù SSL modes introduce an additional SSL handshake between Cloudflare and IONOS.
IONOS occasionally rotates or reissues certificates, leading to **‚ÄúSSL version mismatch‚Äù** or **502 Bad Gateway** errors during revalidation.

---

### 3. **Aggressive Caching / Connection Pooling**

When Cloudflare caches static and dynamic resources together (especially under ‚ÄúCaching Level: Standard‚Äù or ‚ÄúCache Everything‚Äù), it may prematurely close live stream requests that are not cache-compatible.

---

## üß© Verified Environment Affected

| Component | Description                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Registrar | Porkbun (migrating to IONOS)      |
| DNS       | Cloudflare                        |
| Hosting   | IONOS Shared / VPS (74.208.xx.xx) |
| Proxy     | Cloudflare (orange cloud = ON)    |
| SSL       | IONOS Auto-SSL or Let‚Äôs Encrypt   |
| Site Type | Livestream & content portal       |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Solution

### Option 1 ‚Äî **Use Cloudflare DNS Only (Paused Mode)**

If you need consistent uptime for livestreaming or persistent connections:

1. In Cloudflare, open **Overview ‚Üí Advanced Actions ‚Üí Pause Cloudflare on Site**.
2. Verify that all **orange clouds turn grey** (DNS-only).
3. Confirm A records point directly to your IONOS IP.
4. Keep nameservers at Cloudflare (you still get fast global DNS).

**Result:**
All Cloudflare proxy and caching layers are bypassed, while DNS continues resolving globally via Cloudflare‚Äôs network.

> ‚úÖ Ideal for livestreams, broadcasts, or sites needing maximum connection stability.

---

### Option 2 ‚Äî **Fine-Tune Proxy (if you must use it)**

If you still want Cloudflare‚Äôs CDN or WAF for protection:

| Setting               | Recommended Value                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| SSL/TLS Mode          | **Full (Strict)**                                     |
| Caching Level         | **Standard** (avoid Cache Everything)                 |
| Rocket Loader         | **Off**                                               |
| Always Use HTTPS      | **On**                                                |
| Connection Keep-Alive | Enable (server-side)                                  |
| Page Rules            | Exclude `/live`, `/stream`, `/api` paths from caching |

This can reduce disruptions but may not eliminate all hiccups for long-running streams.

---

## üß∞ Additional Tips

* **Export Cloudflare DNS zone** before major changes (`DNS ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Export Zone File`).
* Use **short TTLs (300s)** to allow rapid rollback.
* If Cloudflare proxy must remain off, consider alternate CDN options (e.g., Bunny.net, Akamai, or direct S3/Wasabi distribution for static content).
* Monitor uptime via **UptimeRobot** or **HetrixTools** to detect any residual instability.

Would you like me to provide a **companion visual diagram (network flow before vs. after disabling proxy)** to include in this KB article? It can help explain to non-technical team members why the ‚Äúpaused‚Äù mode is actually more stable for livestreams.

Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs *very* helpful context, and honestly a smart call for your use case.

If your Cloudflare experience caused intermittent ‚Äúhiccups,‚Äù it‚Äôs likely due to their **proxy layer interfering with IONOS‚Äôs caching, SSL, or session routing** ‚Äî which is a known issue, especially with livestreaming, long-running connections, or WebSocket-style stream endpoints.

So your choice to use Cloudflare **only as authoritative DNS (paused mode)** is completely valid ‚Äî and in fact, **it‚Äôs the most stable and safest option** for your planned registrar transfer.

Let‚Äôs outline what that means operationally and how to keep it bulletproof.

## ‚úÖ Recommended Architecture for ElijahStreams

| Layer                      | Provider                         | Role                     | Notes                                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Registrar**              | Currently: Porkbun ‚Üí Soon: IONOS | Domain ownership         | No effect on uptime once Cloudflare hosts DNS |
| **DNS Hosting**            | Cloudflare (paused mode)         | Authoritative DNS only   | Fast, globally redundant, no proxying         |
| **Web Server**             | IONOS (IP: `74.208.87.105`)      | Live web + stream origin | Direct connection ‚Äî no proxy interference     |
| **Email**                  | IONOS (`mx00`/`mx01`)            | Mail routing             | DNS entries already correct                   |
| **Livestream CDN / Embed** | Your streaming provider          | Frontend delivery        | Unaffected by registrar transfer              |

---

## üß± How This Setup Works During Transfer

* **Cloudflare‚Äôs nameservers stay authoritative**, even though its proxy/CDN features are off.
* The registrar transfer (Porkbun ‚Üí IONOS) affects *only domain ownership*, not DNS resolution.
* Your DNS zone (records, TTLs, etc.) remains live and queryable the entire time.
* The site, livestream, and email keep functioning without any propagation delay.

‚úÖ **Net result:** Zero downtime, zero functional change.

---

## üîÅ Your Ideal Transfer Workflow (DNS-Only Cloudflare)

1. **Confirm Cloudflare DNS is complete and accurate**

   * Review all A, MX, TXT, and CNAME records.
   * Export zone file as backup (`Cloudflare ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Export Zone File`).

2. **Confirm ‚ÄúPaused‚Äù status stays ON**

   * This ensures requests go *directly to IONOS*, not through Cloudflare proxy.

3. **At Porkbun**

   * Unlock the domain.
   * Disable WHOIS privacy.
   * Get the EPP/Auth code.

4. **At IONOS**

   * Start the transfer process.
   * When asked about nameservers, choose **‚ÄúKeep existing nameservers.‚Äù**
   * Enter your EPP/Auth code.

5. **Approve the transfer email from Porkbun**

   * That accelerates the move (often 1‚Äì3 days instead of 5‚Äì7).

6. **Wait for completion**

   * DNS will continue to function because Cloudflare remains authoritative.

7. **After confirmation from IONOS**

   * Verify:

     * Auto-renew enabled
     * WHOIS privacy (if desired)
     * DNS still managed via Cloudflare

| Task                                  | Frequency               | Notes                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Export Cloudflare DNS zone            | Before any major change | Backup safety                       |
| Monitor uptime                        | Continuous              | Use UptimeRobot or HetrixTools      |
| Keep TTLs at 300 seconds              | Always                  | Faster rollback if needed           |
| Leave Cloudflare ‚Äúpaused‚Äù permanently | Always                  | Stability + performance consistency |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why ‚ÄúProxy Off‚Äù Works Better for Streaming

* Cloudflare proxies sometimes buffer or interrupt **persistent TCP/RTMP/HLS** connections.
* They can also introduce ‚Äúorigin handshake failures‚Äù if the stream exceeds request limits.
* Paused mode removes that middleman, giving your viewers a *direct line to IONOS*.

You still get the **global DNS reliability and DDoS resilience** (to a degree) from Cloudflare‚Äôs edge network, even when not proxying traffic.

Would you like me to create a **Markdown ‚ÄúHOW-TO: Zero-Downtime Domain Transfer (Cloudflare DNS Only)‚Äù** document formatted like your other internal guides (with version, metadata table, and step-by-step sections)?

It would fit cleanly under your `HOW-TO` folder and be version-controlled like the rest of your documentation.
