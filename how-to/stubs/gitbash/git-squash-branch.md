Perfect — it's smart to protect your work before rewriting history. Here's how to safely squash your branch **while keeping a backup** in case you want to undo or compare later.

---

## 🛟 Safe Squash Workflow (with Backup)

### 🔧 1. **Start on your branch**

```bash
git checkout docs/add-9-10-items
```

### 📌 2. **Create a backup branch**

```bash
git branch backup/docs-add-9-10-items
```

✅ This saves your current branch state (all commits and changes). You can always switch back:

```bash
git checkout backup/docs-add-9-10-items
```

---

### 🧹 3. **Soft reset your current branch (preserve all changes)**

```bash
git reset --soft $(git merge-base master HEAD)
```

✅ This unstitches the commit history, but keeps all your edits staged.

---

### 📝 4. **Create a new squashed commit with a clean message**

```bash
git commit -m "Add KB updates for 9/10 items

- Added new sections for X, Y, Z
- Reorganized headings
- Fixed formatting issues
- Updated links and metadata"
```

💡 Write a clear message that reflects everything you did across those 12 commits.

---

### 🚀 5. **Force-push your squashed commit to the remote branch**

```bash
git push --force
```

This updates your PR to show just **one commit** with the nice message you just wrote.

---

## 🧯 Bonus: Undo if needed

If you ever want to go back to the pre-squash state:

```bash
git checkout docs/add-9-10-items
git reset --hard backup/docs-add-9-10-items
git push --force
```

Let me know if you'd like to alias this as a Git shortcut or script it.
