Great — you're almost done! You’ve already identified the first bad commit using `git bisect`. Now, let’s walk step-by-step (with no steps missed) through what you should do **next** to complete the bisect process and restore your repo to a clean state.

---

## ✅ YOU’VE DONE THIS ALREADY:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <some earlier commit>
```

Git has now finished the bisect process and told you:

> `53e39bd1c985f63f5f660eeb4c4c5f198315a912 is the first bad commit`

---

## ✅ WHAT TO DO NEXT — Step-by-step:

### 🔁 1. **Record / Document the Bad Commit**

Make sure you **note down or copy** the commit hash and summary for your records:

```bash
53e39bd1c985f63f5f660eeb4c4c5f198315a912
"fix(well-spots): remove large vertical gap caused by Vimeo wrapper div"
```

This is the commit that introduced the bug you're trying to fix.

---

### 🧹 2. **Reset the Bisect Session (IMPORTANT)**

Now that Git Bisect has found the bad commit, **you need to tell Git you're done** and want to clean up the temporary state:

```bash
git bisect reset
```

💡 This command:

* Returns you to the branch and commit you were on before running `git bisect start`.
* Cleans up all the bisect refs and state Git used internally.

✅ You **must run this** before doing any further commits, merges, or checkouts.

---

### 📌 3. **(Optional) Checkout the Bad Commit to Inspect or Fix It**

If you want to inspect the bad commit again:

```bash
git checkout 53e39bd1c985f63f5f660eeb4c4c5f198315a912
```

⚠️ But be aware: you'll be in **detached HEAD** state, so don't make new commits unless you create a branch first:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/vimeo-gap-bug
```

---

### 🔧 4. **Take Action Based on the Bad Commit**

Now you can:

* **Fix** the bad commit (if you’re the one who introduced it).
* **Revert** it if it was a mistake.
* **Refactor** the code around it.
* **Notify the team**, file a bug, or whatever your workflow requires.

For example, to revert it:

```bash
git revert 53e39bd1c985f63f5f660eeb4c4c5f198315a912
```

---

### ✅ SUMMARY OF COMMANDS TO RUN NEXT

```bash
git bisect reset
# (optional) Inspect bad commit
git checkout 53e39bd1c985f63f5f660eeb4c4c5f198315a912
# (optional) Create a branch to fix
git checkout -b fix/vimeo-layout-bug
```

If you're not sure what action to take **with the bad commit**, just let me know the context (is it your code? do you want to revert/fix?), and I can guide you further.
