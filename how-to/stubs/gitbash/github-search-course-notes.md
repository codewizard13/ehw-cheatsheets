To answer your question, here’s what’s known about popular GitHub repository tags ("topics") commonly used by **students** (not instructors or official course repos) to track their own notes, coursework, and tutorials:

### Most Popular Student Note Repo Tags

These are typical tags/topics found on student-created note-tracking repos:

- **notes**
- **study-notes**
- **course-notes**
- **lecture-notes**
- **cheatsheet** / **cheatsheets**
- **study-guide**
- **university**
- **college**
- **cs-notes** (for computer science)
- **math-notes**, **physics-notes**, etc. (subject-specific)
- **self-study**
- **tutorials**
- **personal-notes**
- **exam-prep**
- **learning**
- **resources**
- **summary**
- **reference**
- **school**
- **homework**

#### Other context-dependent tags:
- **semester-x** (where x is 1,2,3,...)
- **bio101**, **cs101**, etc. (course codes)
- **undergrad**, **grad** (educational level)
- **mooc** (for online courses)
- **syllabus**

### How these tags differ from instructor repos

- Instructor-created repos often have tags like **assignment**, **homework**, **project-template**, **course-material**, **teaching**, **classwork**, or explicit mention of being “for students.”
- Student repos focus on **personal tracking**, **summaries**, and **study aids** rather than official course delivery.
- Student repos rarely use tags like **teaching** or **instructor**.

### How to find examples

You can search GitHub using:
```
topic:notes topic:study-notes user:<student-username>
```
Or check trending topics on [GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics) for "notes," "study-notes," "course-notes," "cheatsheets," etc.

### Caveats

- There’s no perfect way to guarantee a repo is student-created except by checking the profile and repo description.
- Many students use custom tags or combine tags from their course codes, university, or the subject area.
