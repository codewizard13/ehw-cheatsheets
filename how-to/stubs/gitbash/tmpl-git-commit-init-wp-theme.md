# I don't understand tagging and am not implementing that yet, so create a new verision init template where tagging is optional (should it also be recommended, or just optional?)

Good question — if you’re not yet using Git tags formally, it’s perfectly fine to treat them as **optional** for now. You can build a habit around clean version initialization commits first, then layer tagging later when it makes sense (for CI/CD or release automation).

It’s best to mark tagging as *recommended but optional* — this signals intent for future adoption without forcing immediate use.

### ✅ **Version Initialization Commit Template (Tagging Optional)**

```
🆕  chore(theme): initialize version X.Y.Z development

* Synced `package.json`, `style.css`, `README.md`, and `screenshot.jpg` for vX.Y.Z
* Updated internal documentation and version headers where applicable
* (Optional) Tag this commit as `vX.Y.Z-init` to mark the start of the new cycle
```


***

### 📏 **Guidelines for Version Initialization Commits**

- **Commit type:** `chore(theme)` — because it’s a maintenance/metadata task, not a feature or fix.
- **Emoji:** 🆕 for new version systematization, keeping it visually distinct from finalization commits.
- **Purpose:** Establish a clear “starting line” for the next development cycle right after a final release commit.
- **Files to Update:**
    - `package.json`
    - `style.css` (theme metadata)
    - `README.md` (if includes version or changelog references)
    - `CHANGELOG.md` (insert a “coming soon” header for the new cycle)
    - `screenshot.jpg` (optional if your theme includes visual version overlays)
- **Timing:** Always commit this immediately after merging or tagging a release branch, before adding new features.

### 📝 Example Real Commit

```
🆕  chore(theme): initialize version 4.02.00 development

* Synced `package.json`, `style.css`, `README.md`, and `screenshot.jpg` for v4.02
* Updated changelog header with new development cycle note
* (Optional) Will tag as `v4.02.00-init` once tagging workflow is implemented
```

### 💡 Recommendation

Keep tagging **optional but recommended**.

- Optional → keeps your workflow simple while you’re primarily documenting via commits and changelog.
- Recommended → because once you introduce automated deployment or version detection, Git tags become invaluable for traceability and changelog generation.

Would you like me to create a matching “version finalization” commit template (the one that wraps up each release cycle)?
