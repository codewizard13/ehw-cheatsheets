## 📌 Overview


Git tags serve as permanent reference points to specific commits. Tags are invaluable for release management, rollbacks, deployment snapshots, and internal checkpoints.  
Unlike branches, tags are immutable by design and don't move as development continues.


This guide covers six key use cases with example commands and safety tips, focusing on real-world tag strategies that integrate seamlessly with VSCode and Git Bash workflows.

## ✅ End Goal


After completing this guide, you will be able to:

- Create annotated and lightweight tags correctly  
- Push tags to remote repositories without confusion  
- Understand rollback and reference workflows  
- Use tags for structured release versioning and CI/CD integration  
- Manage tag lists safely both locally and remotely  


---


## 🎯 Tag Use Cases


### 1️⃣ Marking a Release Version

Use a semantic version tag to mark stable checkpoints.

```
git tag v2.0.0
```

This creates a lightweight tag pointing to the current commit.  
Great for marking milestones like feature freeze or final testing cutoffs.


### 2️⃣ Creating an Annotated Tag with Metadata

Add author, date, and message metadata—preferred for production releases.

```
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release 2.0.0: Added dashboard refactor and security updates"
```

Annotated tags are full Git objects and appear in `git show v2.0.0` output.  
Essential for signed or historical releases.


### 3️⃣ Using Lightweight Tags for Quick Snapshots

When experimenting or storing an ephemeral milestone:

```
git tag temp/debug-testing
```

Useful during development when you want an easy rollback marker without writing long messages.  
Lightweight tags are simply named pointers without extra metadata.


### 4️⃣ Pushing and Fetching Tags with Remotes

To share tags with collaborators or deployment pipelines:

```
git push origin v2.0.0
```

Push all tags in one go:

```
git push origin --tags
```

To update your local tag list from remote:

```
git fetch --tags
```


### 5️⃣ Rolling Back to a Tagged Release

Revisit previous versions safely using checkout:

```
git checkout v1.5.0
```

This enters a detached HEAD state referencing that release.  
To fix bugs from that point:

```
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.5.1
```

This branch inherits the codebase from that tagged version.


### 6️⃣ Deleting or Renaming Tags Safely

For a tag created in error:

```
git tag -d v0.9.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.9.0
```

To rename, delete and recreate under a new name:

```
git tag v1.0.0-final v1.0.0
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0-final
```

Exercise caution with renaming tags that have already been used in downstream builds.

## 📊 Visual Comparison of Tag Types


| Tag Type | Command Example | Contains Metadata | Typical Purpose | Best Practice |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Lightweight | `git tag v2.1` | No | Temporary checkpoints | Don't push long-term |
| Annotated | `git tag -a v2.1 -m "message"` | Yes | Official releases | Always use for public versions |
| Signed | `git tag -s v2.1 -m "Signed release"` | Yes + GPG signature | Secure release validation | Use for CI/CD and open source projects |

## 🧩 Git Internals: Tags as Immutable Pointers


Tags act as immutable pointers referencing a specific commit hash.  
Conceptually:

```
commit (v2.0.0)
   ↓
[hash: d3f6b2c]
   │
   └── points to commit objects
```

Tags differ from branches since they never move automatically.  
Deleting a tag only removes the pointer, not the commit itself.
