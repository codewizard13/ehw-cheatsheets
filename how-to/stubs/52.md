---

### 🔍 **Extension in Use**

The UI style and features strongly indicate that the extension in use is:

### 📋 Breakdown of the Screenshot Elements

#### ✅ **Top Section (Commit Info)**

* **Avatar/Icon**: The checkered pattern represents the Git user (you).
* **"You"**: This shows who made the commit (you, the user).
* **"4 weeks ago (September 3rd, 2025 12:50 PM)"**: This shows the relative time and exact date/time of the commit.

#### 📄 **Commit Message**

```
chore(theme): finalize v3.02 and prepare for release
```

This follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format:

* `chore(theme)`: A non-code change related to theming
* `finalize v3.02 and prepare for release`: Description of the change

#### ✏️ **Bullet Point Under Commit**

```
* Updated package\.json, style\.css, README\.md, CHANGELOG\.md and screenshot\.jpg to reflect final release state
```

This is the extended commit message (body), showing which files were updated to finalize version 3.02.

> Note: The backslashes (e.g., `package\.json`) are an escape character used by GitLens or Markdown rendering to handle special characters.

---

### 🔢 **Middle Section (Commit SHA and Controls)**

* `9fe5854`: The **commit hash** (ID of this specific commit).
* 🔍, 🔗, 🌐, 📘, ⚙️ icons: GitLens action buttons:

  * View commit details, open in browser, copy URL, explain commit, configure settings, etc.

---

### 🗂️ **Section Below Commit: Version Tag**

```
## [3.02] (Aug 26 - Sep 3, 2025)
```

* Indicates this commit belongs to release/tag **v3.02**
* Time range: This version covers changes from **Aug 26 to Sep 3, 2025**

---

### 🔄 **Change Range**

```
Changes 1c58ad1 ↔ 9fe5854
```

* Shows the range of changes between these two commits (or commit states):

  * `1c58ad1`: Previous commit
  * `9fe5854`: Current commit
* This is useful for diffing what changed between versions.

---

### 📌 Summary
