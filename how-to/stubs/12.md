For rapid CSS testing in VSCode Markdown previews, placing a `<style>` tag inside the document body is an effective shortcut üí°. It lets you instantly see style changes without reloading the editor, speeding up your workflow üöÄ. Although this practice is discouraged in production HTML, it fits well for quick prototyping. Final styles should be moved to an external stylesheet for maintainability üìÅ and best practices. VSCode also supports linking external CSS for cleaner previews while keeping security and performance balanced üõ°Ô∏è.  

Would you like tips on organizing styles for seamless workflow from rapid prototyping to production readiness?
