**Subject:** Team Action — Test the Testimonial Form by Location  

***

**Hello Team,**  

Over the last few weeks, we’ve noticed that **testimonial submissions have declined**, and we’d like to confirm whether this drop is related to **location, connection speed, or browser differences**.  

Recent tests show that the form works properly for both **Gmail and private domains**, and entries are being **recorded in WPForms** as expected. To help us gather consistent data across regions, we’d like everyone to submit a quick internal test.  


### Action Required  
Please take a few minutes today to complete the test below:  

**1.** Open the Testimonial form (link below).  
**2.** Write a short, simple test testimonial (content can be informal).  
**3.** Include #TESTING in the message body so we can identify your entry.  
**4.** Enter your **actual city and state** in the location field to help us track patterns.  


### Why This Matters  
This test will help us verify whether submission issues are **region-specific** or tied to **environmental variables** such as browser, IP routing, or caching. Once all results are received, we’ll review them to confirm steady form performance across the U.S.  

***

**Thank you** for your help and prompt participation.  
Your input ensures the testimonial form remains dependable before opening new public campaigns.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

=======================================




quick heads-up — Peter and I noticed a drop in testimonial submissions since the end of September. I tested it today using two different email domains and got the expected “success” confirmation each time, but no confirmation email was received by the user.

✅ Submissions are registering correctly as pending testimonial posts, so nothing appears broken — but the lack of confirmations + drop in volume seems odd.

Would you be okay if I draft an email asking the team to help test this? Happy to send the draft to you first for review if you’d like.
