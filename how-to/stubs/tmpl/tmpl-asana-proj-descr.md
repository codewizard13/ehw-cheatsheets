It’s a good idea to document **the launch date** of Version 3 (today, September 18, 2025) in the project description. That way, your team has a clear reference for when this maintenance phase began. Other useful items to include in a project description for website maintenance are:  

- 📅 **Launch date** of current version  
- 🔗 **Links to documentation** (theme docs, code repo, style guides)  
- 👤 **Points of contact** (developer lead, designer lead, QA contact)  
- 📝 **Scope of tickets** (bugs, enhancements, performance, content updates)  
- ⚡ **Priority guidelines** for differentiating urgent fixes vs. backlog tasks  
- 🔒 **Access details** for staging/production (kept secure, but noted where found)  
- 🔄 **Release process** (how changes are deployed and tested)  

Here’s the revised description with your addendum:  

***

**Project Description**  
🚀 This board is dedicated to tracking **tickets and issues** for maintaining **SITE.COM** following the **Version 3 overhaul** launched on **September 18, 2025**.  

🔧 With the new launch, our infrastructure moved away from the old **child theme** and **custom WordPress site customization plugin**, and now all customizations are built directly into **site-theme**, our custom theme designed by **MY-BIZ web design staff**.  

📋 Use this board to log, track, and resolve:  
- 🐛 Bugs and functional issues  
- 🎨 Design or styling adjustments  
- ⚡ Performance concerns  
- 🛠 Ongoing maintenance tasks  

✅ This ensures SITE.COM stays reliable, fast, and aligned with our new streamlined setup.

**About this Project (Short Blurb)**  
🎯 Tracks tickets and issues for **SITE.COM** maintenance after the **Version 3 (Sept 18, 2025) launch**, now powered fully by the custom **site-theme**.

Would you like me to draft a suggested **priority levels framework** (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) for tickets so your Asana board has built-in guidelines?
