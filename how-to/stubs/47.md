Great question — and yes, it’s generally **totally fine** to include a **"Prompt:"** label at the start of your input. Most modern LLMs, including this one, are smart enough to recognize that it’s just a label or heading you're adding for clarity. Here's a breakdown:

---

### ✅ **When it's safe and useful:**

* **Clarity for you**: Helps you organize reusable prompts.
* **Clarity for others**: Useful if you're sharing prompts with someone else or saving them.
* **LLMs**: Will typically ignore the `"Prompt:"` label as just text and focus on the content that follows.

---

### ⚠️ **Minor risks or edge cases:**

* In **code-related or automation contexts** (like API requests or scripted prompts), prepending `"Prompt:"` could be misinterpreted if the system expects a raw prompt only.
* If your prompt is super short or ambiguous, the word `"Prompt:"` might slightly influence the output, but this is rare and usually negligible.

---

### ✅ Best Practice (if you want to be extra safe):

If you want to keep the label for clarity, just add a newline or colon to clearly separate the prompt body:

```txt
Prompt:
Write a concise intro paragraph for...
```

or

```txt
Prompt — Write a concise intro paragraph for...
```

So yes — **go ahead and use it** for clarity. It won't confuse ChatGPT or most other well-designed systems.
