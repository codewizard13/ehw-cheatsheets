# Index for: HOW TO / STUBS

[🏚️ HOME](../README.md)

**In this Folder:**

<section class="ehw-doc-descr">

This folder contains **numbered documentation stubs** — rough outlines, prompts, and partial drafts for potential KB articles. These are **not public-facing** and are marked as `WIP` (Work-in-Progress). They exist to support rapid documentation prototyping, internal collaboration, and idea capture before conversion into finalized how‑to guides.

These files are **incomplete** and in various stages of brainstorming. Use them for reference, iteration, or conversion into finalized guides.

<section class="ehw-doc-descr">
Each numbered file represents a potential documentation seed. Some may contain working notes, others may just be placeholders.
