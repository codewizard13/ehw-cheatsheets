It‚Äôs a good idea to document **the launch date** of Version 3 (today, September 18, 2025) in the project description. That way, your team has a clear reference for when this maintenance phase began. Other useful items to include in a project description for website maintenance are:  

- üìÖ **Launch date** of current version  
- üîó **Links to documentation** (theme docs, code repo, style guides)  
- üë§ **Points of contact** (developer lead, designer lead, QA contact)  
- üìù **Scope of tickets** (bugs, enhancements, performance, content updates)  
- ‚ö° **Priority guidelines** for differentiating urgent fixes vs. backlog tasks  
- üîí **Access details** for staging/production (kept secure, but noted where found)  
- üîÑ **Release process** (how changes are deployed and tested)  

Here‚Äôs the revised description with your addendum:  

***

**Project Description**  
üöÄ This board is dedicated to tracking **tickets and issues** for maintaining **[ElijahStreams.com](https://ElijahStreams.com)** following the **Version 3 overhaul** launched on **September 18, 2025**.  

üîß With the new launch, our infrastructure moved away from the old **child theme** and **custom WordPress site customization plugin**, and now all customizations are built directly into **elijah-theme**, our custom theme designed by **ElijahStreams web design team**.  

üìã Use this board to log, track, and resolve:  
- üêõ Bugs and functional issues  
- üé® Design or styling adjustments  
- ‚ö° Performance concerns  
- üõ† Ongoing maintenance tasks  

‚úÖ This ensures ElijahStreams.com stays reliable, fast, and aligned with our new streamlined setup.  

***

**About this Project (Short Blurb)**  
üéØ Tracks tickets and issues for **ElijahStreams.com** maintenance after the **Version 3 (Sept 18, 2025) launch**, now powered fully by the custom **site-theme**.  

---  

Would you like me to draft a suggested **priority levels framework** (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) for tickets so your Asana board has built-in guidelines?
