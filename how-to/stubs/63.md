Yes, this does seem like a **quirk**, though not a *common* one in classic WordPress theme development. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs likely going on and how to fix it:

---

## üîç What's Causing the `package.json not found` Error?

You're seeing repeated errors like:

```
package.json not found at .../themes/elijah-theme/inc/package.json
```

This suggests that **some code in your theme is trying to locate a `package.json` inside your `inc/` folder**, which is not typical for classic themes.

### ‚úÖ In a typical WordPress (classic) theme:

* `package.json` (if used at all) usually sits at the **root of the theme**, not inside `inc/`.
* It‚Äôs only needed if you're using build tools (like Webpack, Gulp, Vite, etc.).

---

## üîß Possible Causes

### 1. **Misconfigured Asset Loader or Build Tool**

If your theme includes a custom PHP-based asset loader (e.g., loading compiled JS/CSS based on a manifest), it might be misconfigured to look in the wrong place.

Check if you're using something like:

```php
$manifest = json_decode(file_get_contents(get_template_directory() . '/inc/package.json'), true);
```

That would explain it ‚Äî it's looking in `/inc/package.json`, which almost certainly doesn‚Äôt exist.

### 2. **Incorrect Path in `functions.php` or Custom Class**

Look for lines like:

```php
$package = file_get_contents( get_template_directory() . '/inc/package.json' );
```

or

```php
require 'inc/package.json';
```

This might be trying to read something that doesn't belong there.

---

## üîß Solution

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Locate the offending code

Search your theme's PHP files (especially `functions.php` or `inc/` files) for:

* `package.json`
* `file_get_contents`
* `json_decode`
* `require`

Look for paths pointing to `/inc/package.json`.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Fix the path or remove the logic

If you're using a build system:

* Ensure `package.json` exists at the root of the theme (e.g., `/wp-content/themes/elijah-theme/package.json`).
* Update the path in PHP accordingly:

```php
$package_path = get_template_directory() . '/package.json';
```

If you're **not** using a build tool or don't need `package.json`:

* Just **delete or comment out the code** trying to read it.

---

## üß† Regarding the `Attempt to read property "ID" on null` Warnings

This is unrelated but also important. It‚Äôs coming from `link-template.php`, typically caused by trying to use post-related functions **outside the loop** or when there's **no global `$post` object available**.

Example cause:

```php
get_permalink(); // without a post context
```

‚úÖ Wrap it in a check or provide a post ID:

```php
if ( get_the_ID() ) {
    $link = get_permalink( get_the_ID() );
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* `package.json` being searched in `/inc/` is likely a **hardcoded path mistake** in your theme code.
* Fix the path or remove the code if unused.
* The `ID on null` warnings are likely due to post-related functions running without a valid `$post`.

If you'd like, you can paste the theme‚Äôs `functions.php` or relevant `inc/*.php` code and I can help pinpoint the exact line.
