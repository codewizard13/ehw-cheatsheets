Here is a concise prompt to generate your desired WordPress admin dashboard banner with debug logs:

***

Create a WordPress custom dashboard widget that displays the following HTML only on the main admin dashboard:

```html
<div style="background:orange;padding:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;margin-top:2.5rem;display:flex;justify-content:flex-end;">
  <h3>Hey I love Apples!</h3>
</div>
```

Use the hook `wp_dashboard_setup` and `wp_add_dashboard_widget()`. Include debug `error_log` statements inside the main function and the widget callback to confirm execution. Use a closure with `use()` or define the content in the correct scope to avoid "undefined variable" errors. Provide the PHP snippet suitable for placing in a themeâ€™s `functions.php` or a custom plugin.

***

This will prompt the generation of the code you need including debugging and scope fixes.
