**Q:** How can I use Local by Flywheel / LocalWP with a non-WordPress site?

Although you may use WordPress for absolutely everything, there may be occasions where you break away from the CMS for one reason or another. And if [Local](https://torquemag.io/2020/05/how-to-use-local-by-flywheel/) is your tool of choice for offline development, you might think you have to switch to a different one because you can‚Äôt use it without WordPress.

Thankfully, that‚Äôs not the case.¬†

Today, we‚Äôll show you how to set up and use Local to without WordPress. We‚Äôll discuss what other types of sites you can build with Local, how to access the files and database you need to do it, how to save this non-WordPress site as a blueprint for future use, and suggest some other tools to get the job done.¬†
