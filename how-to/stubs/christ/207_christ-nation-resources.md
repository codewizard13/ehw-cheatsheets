To explore the **biblical foundations** of Christian Nationalism and how this movement connects with God’s call to righteous governance, the following resources provide strong scriptural grounding, historical evidence, and prophetic context.

### ✅ Foundational and Supportive Resources

**Canon Press — [*The Case for Christian Nationalism*](https://canonpress.com/products/group-study-bundle-the-case-for-christian-nationalism)**
A detailed theological case for national stewardship under God, written by Stephen Wolfe. It argues that nations, like individuals, are called to order themselves toward Christ’s lordship and righteousness.

**WallBuilders (David Barton) — [*America’s Biblical Foundation*](https://wallbuilders.com/)**
Demonstrates from original documents that America’s founders drew directly from Scripture, not Enlightenment secularism. Barton's work consistently defends America’s biblical roots and the believer’s role in civic life.

**William J. Federer — [*American Minute*](https://americanminute.com/)**
Federer’s extensive historical writings highlight how nations that honored God thrived, while those that rejected Him declined — aligning with Deuteronomy 28 principles of national blessing and curse.

**ElijahStreams (Platform)** — [ElijahStreams YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ElijahStreams)
Publishes ongoing prophetic words and interpretations from voices such as Robin D. Bullock, Johnny Enlow, Kat Kerr, Hank Kunneman, and Amanda Grace — connecting Scripture with God’s current move in America and globally.

### ⚖️ Detractors and Counterpoints

Understanding opposing viewpoints helps believers discern between **biblical prophetic truth** and **humanistic or fear-driven interpretations** that distort the term *Christian Nationalism.*

**BibleStudyTools — [*Is Christian Nationalism Biblical?*](https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/is-christian-nationalism-biblical.html)**
A critical article claiming Christian Nationalism confuses the Kingdom of God with earthly politics and risks idolatry of nation.

**Chalice Press — [*The Bible According to Christian Nationalists*](https://chalicepress.com/products/the-bible-according-to-christian-nationalists)**
A progressive theological critique asserting that Christian Nationalists misuse Scripture to justify political authority.

**Christianity Today (Various Articles)**
Frequently presents Christian Nationalism as a “false gospel” blending politics with faith — often dismissing prophetic interpretations about Trump and America’s divine calling.

**Secular and Humanistic Critics**
Media outlets like *The Atlantic* and *NPR* frame Christian Nationalism as a democratic threat or authoritarian movement. These analyses rely on sociopolitical fear rather than biblical theology.

**Historical Mischaracterizations**
References to the Catholic Inquisition or early American sectarian conflicts are often used as scare examples. As historian **William J. Federer** notes, these represented *unregenerate religion* — not Spirit-led governance rooted in Scripture.

### 🧭 Suggested Study Path

To build a biblically informed and historically grounded understanding, follow this progression:

1. **Start with Scripture:**

   * *Psalm 33:12*, *Proverbs 14:34*, *Isaiah 45*, *Matthew 5:13–16*, *Romans 13:1–4*.
   * Meditate on how these passages describe nations under God’s order and righteousness.

2. **Study Historical Foundations:**

   * Read David Barton’s *America’s Biblical Foundation* (WallBuilders) for primary-source context.
   * Follow with William Federer’s *American Minute* series to see recurring patterns in history.

3. **Examine the Theological Framework:**

   * Work through Stephen Wolfe’s *The Case for Christian Nationalism* (Canon Press).
   * Discuss in groups using the Canon Press study bundle for deeper engagement.

4. **Hear the Prophetic Perspective:**

   * Watch recent ElijahStreams episodes featuring Robin Bullock, Johnny Enlow, and Amanda Grace.
   * Note how their words align with Scripture rather than secular commentary.

5. **Evaluate Counterpoints with Discernment:**

   * Read one or two critical sources (BibleStudyTools, Chalice Press, Christianity Today).
   * Compare their reasoning against the Word and prophetic insights to sharpen spiritual discernment.

6. **Pray and Act:**

   * Intercede for the nation (1 Timothy 2:1–2).
   * Ask God how you can personally model righteous influence in your sphere of calling.

### Final Reflections

**True Christian Nationalism**, as taught by biblically faithful voices and confirmed by prophetic revelation, is not about domination or forced religion — it’s about **national alignment with divine righteousness**.

> *“Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD.”* — **Psalm 33:12**
> *“Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.”* — **Proverbs 14:34**
