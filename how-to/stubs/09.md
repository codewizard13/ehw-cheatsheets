Here’s a breakdown of the common understanding of the following terms among most developers, especially in the context of Git and **conventional commits** (although conventional commits themselves are more about commit message formatting):

---

### 1. **Manual Merge**

**Meaning (general):**
A **manual merge** refers to the process of combining changes from different branches or code versions **by hand**, outside of the automatic tools provided by Git.

**Typical use case:**

* Git couldn’t automatically merge changes due to a conflict.
* The developer manually edits the conflicting files to resolve the conflict.
* Sometimes done without even invoking `git merge`, just by copy-pasting code.

**Developer understanding:**
"Git couldn't figure this out for me. I had to step in and handle it manually."

---

### 2. **Cut-and-Paste Consolidation**

**Meaning:**
This is a **non-Git-assisted** merging method where a developer manually consolidates code from different branches or files by **copying and pasting** pieces of code to build a unified version.

**Typical use case:**

* Developers work outside of Git’s conflict resolution.
* Used when branches diverge significantly.
* Sometimes used for refactoring or combining similar files manually.

**Developer understanding:**
"I didn't trust Git to handle the merge or it was too messy, so I just pulled in what I needed by hand."

**Note:** This is often seen as **error-prone** and **non-ideal**, especially in team environments.

### 3. **Git Merge**

**Meaning:**
`git merge` is the Git command that tries to combine the histories of two branches.

**What it does:**

* Attempts to automatically combine changes from a specified branch into the current branch.
* If successful, creates a merge commit.
* If not, results in a **conflict**.

**Developer understanding:**
"This is the standard, built-in way to bring another branch’s changes into mine. Sometimes it's smooth, sometimes not."

---

### 4. **Git Conflict Merge** (or **Merge Conflict Resolution**)

**Meaning:**
This refers to what happens when `git merge` fails to fully reconcile changes, resulting in **conflicts** that must be resolved **manually** before the merge can be completed.

**What you see:**

* Git marks conflicting sections in files (e.g., with `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> branch-name`).
* The developer must edit these files to choose which changes to keep (or how to combine them).
* Once resolved, the developer marks them as resolved (`git add <file>`) and completes the merge (`git commit`).

**Developer understanding:**
"This is when Git says 'I don’t know how to combine this.' I have to go into the code and fix it myself before I can move forward."

### Summary Table

| Term                            | Git-involved | Manual?      | Typical Use Case              | Common Dev Understanding                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual Merge**                | Sometimes    | Yes          | Git conflict or non-Git merge | "I handled this outside of Git's automation."             |
| **Cut-and-Paste Consolidation** | No           | Yes          | Manual code consolidation     | "I copied code pieces to combine things manually."        |
| **Git Merge**                   | Yes          | No (usually) | Combining branches            | "Standard way to bring branches together."                |
| **Git Conflict Merge**          | Yes          | Partially    | Handling merge conflicts      | "When Git can’t merge, I resolve the conflicts manually." |

Let me know if you’d like a **conventional commit message** that describes one of these actions, e.g., how to format a commit message after a manual merge.
