### 2. Exporting Emails from Thunderbird Using ImportExportTools NG

#### Exporting a Full Account Backup with Folder Structure

1. **Right-click** on the email account (such as a Gmail or Yahoo folder) in Thunderbird’s left sidebar.
2. Hover over **ImportExportTools NG** in the context menu.
3. Select **Export all folders** > **Export all folders with subfolders (with structure)**.
4. Choose a **destination folder** on your computer where you want to save the exported files and click **Select Folder**.
5. A progress bar will appear as Thunderbird begins the export. Depending on the size of your account, this could take a few minutes.
6. After the process completes, your destination folder will contain a structure mirroring your account’s folder organization. Each folder will include an `.mbox` file containing the emails from that folder.

**Tip:** If your emails are labeled or tagged, ensure the *Export tags* option is enabled in the ImportExportTools NG settings to retain this metadata.

### 3. Importing Emails Back into Thunderbird

If you need to restore your emails, you can import them back into Thunderbird using ImportExportTools NG.

1. **Right-click** on **Local Folders** in the left sidebar.
2. Hover over **ImportExportTools NG**.
3. Select **Import mbox file**.
4. Choose **Import directly one or more mbox files** or **All mbox Files from directory (with .sbd structure)** if you’re importing a folder structure.
5. Browse to the location of your saved MBOX files and click **Open**.
6. Thunderbird will load the emails into the specified local folder, where you can view, search, and organize them.

### 4. Verifying Exported Files and Understanding File Structure

The files created during export will generally be in **MBOX format**—a standard file format used by many email clients. Here’s what to expect when viewing these files:

- **MBOX Files:** These files typically don’t have an extension, but they can be viewed with any MBOX-compatible application or text editor.
- **.sbd Folders:** Thunderbird uses .sbd folders to organize subfolders, so don’t delete or modify these—they’re essential for preserving your folder hierarchy.
  
To view the contents of an MBOX file, you can import it back into Thunderbird (as described above) or use a dedicated MBOX viewer.

### 5. Searching Exported Emails and Accessing Attachments

After importing MBOX files into Thunderbird, you can take advantage of Thunderbird’s powerful search features:

1. In Thunderbird, locate the **Search Bar** at the top of the screen.
2. Type keywords to search across email subjects, senders, or body content.
3. For advanced searches, click the down arrow next to the search bar to filter by fields like **From**, **To**, **Subject**, and **Date**.

Attachments can be viewed and downloaded directly within Thunderbird by opening the email and clicking on the attachment name.

### 6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting Tips

#### Missing Messages After Export

If your export seems incomplete or is missing messages, especially from an IMAP account:

- **Synchronize Folders:** Before exporting, ensure all folders are fully synced. Go to **Properties** under the account name, then enable **Keep messages for this account on this computer** in the **Synchronization & Storage** section.
  
#### Exporting Local IMAP Copies

When exporting from IMAP, remember you’re backing up only the emails currently downloaded to Thunderbird. If you need all messages, including older or archived emails, fully sync your account before exporting.

### 7. Alternative Free Tools for Viewing and Searching MBOX Files

If you want to explore other tools outside of Thunderbird, here are some free, open-source options:

- **MBox Viewer**: A versatile tool with robust search capabilities, allowing you to view, search, and download attachments from MBOX files.
- **MailSpring**: Open-source email client that supports MBOX imports and provides advanced search features.
- **Evolution** (Linux): GNOME email client with MBOX support and strong search capabilities.
