# WordPress: How to Create a Custom Post type

[üèöÔ∏è](../README.md) | [How To](/how-to/index.md)

Custom post types (CPTs) is a concept that many new to WordPress development may find intimidating. If you ever look at the code for a CPT, or try to follow tutorials from the talented **[Alecaddd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTkbDBhXBQI&list=PLriKzYyLb28kR_CPMz8uierDWC2y3znI2&index=5&ab_channel=AlessandroCastellani)**, you may find yourself asking things like:

- What does it mean to "register" a post type?
- What is the difference between "register" and "create"?
- Why is there 30+ individual properties in a CPT and what are they for?
- When do I use rewrite - what am I rewriting?
- Should I use hierarchical or not?
- How do I associate a custom taxonomy with a CPT?

But, maybe you don't even know what a custom post type is or why you would want one.

## What is a custom post type?

WordPress core includes two main "post types": posts and pages. The main difference is that pages are for things that rarely change, like a contact page or an "About Us" page. Pages are also **hierarchical** (*out of scope for this post*), whereas posts are not.

Posts, on the other hand, are what a basically blog page is. But, there's only so much you can do with blog post.

What if your website is a blog, and you want each blog to link out to one or more recipe posts on your site? You could create a custom post type of "Recipe". Creating the post type means to write the code. Registering the post type means notifying WordPress that your new code exists and should be treated as a custom post type. Now, each CPT can have a different template assigned. That means that a recipe post could even be displayed within a blog post by using the `<iframe>` tag.

Also, each custom post type can have its own archive page template layout and styling. That means that 

## Creating a custom post type

In many "how-to" articles about creating custom post types (CPTs), the authors seem to assume that the reader has been making CPTs for years and so leaves out some -- I think -- important information, namely "Where do you put the code"?

They will usually say something like "you can add it to a plugin or put it in your functions.php", which is technically true. However, it is an incomplete instruction for a beginner to WordPress custom post types.

**What is a WordPress plugin anyway?** Basically, it is a folder with at least one file: the main plugin file. The main plugin file must have a specifically formatted file header comment.

So, now that we know what a plugin is, we can create a custom post type with its own plugin.

## Creating the Custom Post Type with a Plugin

Ok, let's discuss how to create a custom post type.

There are many ways to create a custom post type. The quickest way for a beginner is often to use a plugin. Until recently, Custom Post Type UI was the tool of choice. However, with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin having been acquired by WPEngine last year, the ACF plugin now has post type creation integrated. This makes it easier to create and manage all your custom content without the clutter of extra plugins.

But, you never know what changes a given plugin creator might pull. They could suddenly start charging for what used to be free. They could completely go out of business. They could just stop updating the plugin making it vulnerable to security issues.

That's why I recommend knowing how to write a custom post type from scratch with code. But, it's not really that complicated once you understand the basics.

## Creating a CPT with an Online Code Generator

Rather than write it all out by hand, it is much easier to use an online generator. Once you have a CPT generated, you can use that as a template for all your other CPTs. If for some reason the internet or a the generator site isn't available, you can simply duplicate to your template and globally replace your post type references. :)

The two that I've used are **[GenerateWP](https://generatewp.com/post-type/)** and **[Metabox](https://metabox.io/post-type-generator/)** Some other options include:

- https://wpturbo.dev/generators/post-type/
- https://www.wp-hasty.com/tools/wordpress-custom-post-type-generator/
- https://wp-skills.com/tools/custom-post-type-generator

I'll use Metabox going forward.

## Creating a Custom Post Type with Metabox

### Create Plugin Folder

First, let's create our plugin folder in `wp-content/plugins/` using this naming structure:

    [your-initials]-wiki-plugin

Based on my initials, I will create this plugin folder: **elh-wiki-plugin**

### Create Main Plugin File

Then, we will create our main plugin file. We'll do the customary thing and give it the same name as our folder. So our main plugin file path will be: 

`wp-content/plugins/elh-wiki-plugin/elh-wiki-plugin.php`

Good. Now, we need to add the plugin header like this (don't forget the `<?php` at the top):

    <?php
    /*
    Plugin Name: ELH Wiki Custom Post Type Plugin
    */

As long as you have the correct path, you can go to the "Plugins" page in the WordPress admin and your new plugin will show up in the list. Simply by adding the "Plugin Name:" property, _**you have now registered your plugin!**_

![Our new plugin is registered and viewable on the Plugins page](../_pix/screens/screen--01--wpadmin-plugins__custom-plugin.jpg)

Our plugin doesn't do anything useful at this point, so we still have more to do. Let's fill out the rest of the common header comment properties. After we add a description, version, and author information, the plugin header should look something like this:

    <?php
    /*
    Plugin Name:    ELH Wiki Custom Post Type Plugin
    Description:    A plugin that registers the "doc" custom post type (CPT) for a wiki or knowledgebase website.
    Version:        0.00.00
    Author:         Eric Hepperle
    Author URI:     https://EricHepperle.com
    */

Refresh the Plugins page and your plugin entry should look like this:

![Our wiki CPT plugin on the Plugins page after adding other plugin details](/_pix/screens/screen--02--wpadmin-plugins__custom-plugin.jpg)

**Note**: *The Author URI doesn't require the "https" part, and URLS are not case sensiteve, so I use upper camel to make the individual words in the URL stand out better.*

## Generate the Custom Post Type Plugin Code

Next, navigate to https://metabox.io/post-type-generator/. Let's create a custom post type for a knowledgebase / wiki. The post type is often called "doc" or "article" or even "kb". We'll call ours "doc" because it's short and makes sense. But, basically a doc is a wiki article.

**NOTE:** The text-domain is usually the name of the plugin folder and serves as a form of namespacing.

Let's fill out the post type generator form fields with the following information:

- **Plural name**: Docs
- **Singular name**: Doc
- **Slug**: doc
- **Function name**: register_cpt_doc
- **Text domain**: elh-wiki-plugins

![Metabox online custom post type generator fields](/_pix/screens/screen--03--metabox--cpt-gen--doc.jpg)

Now, click the "Generate Code" button and you should have something like this:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'init', 'register_cpt_doc' );
function register_cpt_doc() {
	$args = [
		'label'  => esc_html__( 'Docs', 'text-domain' ),
		'labels' => [
			'menu_name'          => esc_html__( 'Docs', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'name_admin_bar'     => esc_html__( 'Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'add_new'            => esc_html__( 'Add Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'add_new_item'       => esc_html__( 'Add new Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'new_item'           => esc_html__( 'New Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'edit_item'          => esc_html__( 'Edit Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'view_item'          => esc_html__( 'View Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'update_item'        => esc_html__( 'View Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'all_items'          => esc_html__( 'All Docs', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'search_items'       => esc_html__( 'Search Docs', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'parent_item_colon'  => esc_html__( 'Parent Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'not_found'          => esc_html__( 'No Docs found', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'not_found_in_trash' => esc_html__( 'No Docs found in Trash', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'name'               => esc_html__( 'Docs', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
			'singular_name'      => esc_html__( 'Doc', 'elh-wiki-plugin' ),
		],
		'public'              => true,
		'exclude_from_search' => false,
		'publicly_queryable'  => true,
		'show_ui'             => true,
		'show_in_nav_menus'   => true,
		'show_in_admin_bar'   => true,
		'show_in_rest'        => true,
		'capability_type'     => 'post',
		'hierarchical'        => false,
		'has_archive'         => true,
		'query_var'           => true,
		'can_export'          => true,
		'rewrite_no_front'    => false,
		'show_in_menu'        => false,
		'supports' => [
			'title',
			'editor',
			'thumbnail',
		],
		
		'rewrite' => true
	];

	register_post_type( 'doc', $args );
}
```



Now, go into the Plugins page and activate your plugin.

Refresh the page ... but wait ... the menu for our "Doc" isn't showing up in the left sidebar! What to do?

We need to go back to the generator.

Click the "Advanced" tab. Under "Show in menu?" select "Show as top level menu". Copy the code and replace the previous version... or ... you could just change one line of code.

Let's take the "change one line" option and save a bit of unnecessary clicks.

Find the `show_in_menu` property and change the value from false to true.

![Set show_in_menu to true](/_pix/screens/screen--04--metabox--cpt-gen--doc.jpg)

Now refresh the wpadmin page and you should see the "Docs" in the sidebar.

Let's also change `hierarchical` to true. This way we can use our "Doc" CPT as the base and we can create various doc (article) types including "Person", "Place", "Historical-Event", "Thing", etc. later.

---


Ok, those were easy ones, but for the next changes, we need to go back to the generator because it will need to add some properties that we don't have yet.

Here are some things we need still:

- Select an appropriate menu dashicon ("dashicon" is just WordPress' proprietary icon set, similar to FontAwesome or emojis, but with less options)
- Select where in the menu we want our Docs item to display
- Enable archive
- Change the archive from "doc" to "docs"
- Change the custom rewrite slug from "doc" to "docs"

### Advanced Tab

The "Advanced" tab has a lot of interesting settings. This is where we can select the menu icon, where our menu item should be in the menu (after "Dashboard", after "Media", etc.). We can even choose in this generator to have it be a sub-menu to existing menus like Dashboard or Settings, for instance. This tab is also where we can determine if we want an **archive** (a special page that formats a list of posts instead of a single post) and whether we want to change the default URL structure.

For our CPT project, we will use these settings:









| Label                             | Value                                                                                                                                     |

| Custom rewrite slug               | docs                                                                                                                                      |
| No prepended permalink structure? | false                                                                                                                                     |

Let's quickly cover some important points:

**Exclude from search**: In some cases you might want to have a CPT connected to another CPT through relationships. For example, maybe we have an "author" CPT and each author is related to a "business" CPT. If we want to display information from the business, but we don't want the public to be able to search for business posts, we can set exclude to `true`. However, most often we will leave this unchecked or `false`.

**Has archive**: If for some reason you wanted to not share an archive (either with the public or with search engines), then we would leave it unchecked in the generator (or type `false` in the code).

On the other hand, if you ***do*** want an archive (as with our project and most others) then you have two options: either set to `true` or a custom archive URL slug. For instance, if we set to `true`, then our URL endpoint will look like this:

	[sitename]/doc

Why? Because that's the default slug (singular) that we have set at the end of the code on the line that looks like this:

	register_post_type( 'doc', $args );

However, if we want our URL endpoint to be plural like this,

	[sitename]/docs

then we set the `has_archive` value to `docs`.

We could actually set it to anything - we could set it to 'clown-tears' if we wanted:

	[sitename]/clown-tears

Perhaps a more practical example is that while having a really short base slug of `doc`, we could set `has_archive` to `articles` and it would look like this:

	[sitename]/articles


### Supports Tab

In the supports tab, we'll add revisions so go ahead and enable that. In your own projects you can enable/disable whatever you need.

### Taxonomies Tab

Finally, let's add support for categories and tags. Go ahead and enable those checkboxes for now.

### Final CPT Code

Here's the final code you should end up with in our custom post type plugin:

```php
