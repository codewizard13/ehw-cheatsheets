# WordPress: Production-Ready WordPress Themes

[üèöÔ∏è](../README.md) | [WordPress](index.md)

When deploying your WordPress theme from development to production, there are indeed files and settings that should be handled differently. Here's what you should consider:

## Files to Exclude from Production

1. Development dependencies:
   - `/node_modules` directory[6]
   - `package.json` and `package-lock.json`[1]
   - `webpack.mix.js` or other build configuration files[1]

2. Source files:
   - `/src` directory containing your raw SCSS and JS files[1]

3. Development-specific files:
   - `tailwind.config.json` or similar configuration files[1]
   - Any local environment configuration files

4. Version control files:
   - `.git` directory
   - `.gitignore`

## Settings to Change

1. Debug settings:
   - Set `WP_DEBUG` to `false` in your `wp-config.php` file[8]
   - Disable any development-specific logging or error reporting

2. Environment type:
   - Set `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` to `production` in `wp-config.php`[8]

3. Performance optimizations:
   - Enable caching mechanisms
   - Ensure all assets are minified and optimized

4. Security measures:
   - Disable file editing in the WordPress admin:
     ```php
     define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
     ```

## Best Practices for Deployment

1. Use version control (Git) to manage your theme files[9]

2. Implement a deployment pipeline or use a deployment tool to automate the process[9]

3. Always test your theme thoroughly on a staging environment before deploying to production[5]

4. Use Composer to manage WordPress core, plugins, and themes as dependencies[10]

5. Consider using a child theme for customizations if you're building upon an existing theme[7]

By following these guidelines, you'll ensure that only necessary production files are deployed, and your live site is optimized for performance and security.
