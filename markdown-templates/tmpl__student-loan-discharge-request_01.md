# STUDENT LOANS (USA): Help me compose a letter requesting a default judgement and complete forgiveness of my student loan debt. I'm not a teacher, so I didn't complete the courses that allowed for automatic forgiveness. Biden's admin forgave 50% of my debt (~\$25K), but I still have \$25K I can't pay and the interest is \$3K+!!!!

Here’s how to create a strong, persuasive letter requesting full forgiveness of your remaining student loan balance, emphasizing hardship, partial forgiveness received, and fairness grounds.

Subject: Request for Default Judgment and Full Student Loan Forgiveness  

Dear Federal Student Aid Review Committee,  

I am writing to formally request a default judgment and complete forgiveness of my remaining federal student loan balance, currently totaling approximately $25,000, with accrued interest exceeding $3,000.  

Under President Biden’s loan forgiveness initiative, I received partial relief that reduced my balance by about half. While deeply grateful for that action, I remain in significant financial hardship, unable to meet the requirements for repayment or further forgiveness programs because I did not complete a qualifying teaching program.  

Despite this, my circumstances align with the government’s broader goals of providing relief to borrowers facing ongoing financial strain and disproportionate debt burdens. The remaining balance and compounded interest have become unmanageable, contributing to long-term financial instability.  

I respectfully request a full discharge of my remaining debt on the grounds of:  
- Demonstrated financial hardship preventing repayment;  
- Prior partial forgiveness establishing eligibility review;  
- Good faith efforts to comply with program requirements and maintain communication with loan servicers.  

If any additional documentation (income verification, hardship statement, tax returns, or loan account details) is required, please advise, and I will provide it promptly.  

This request is made sincerely and in reliance on the Department’s continued efforts to ensure fair and just relief for borrowers facing extraordinary financial difficulty.  

Thank you for reviewing my request and for your continued work supporting borrowers during this period of structural reform and transition. I look forward to your consideration and response.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Would you like this letter tailored more toward **financial hardship** (focusing on inability to pay and expenses) or **equity and fairness** (emphasizing policy inconsistency and partial forgiveness already granted)?
