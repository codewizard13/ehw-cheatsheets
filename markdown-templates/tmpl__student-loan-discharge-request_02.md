# Administrative loan discharge based on financial hardship - Just lost my job and now have zero income (except 2 months severance, which is all I have to live on and support my family through the rough winter months.

Details from the letter: US DEPT ED  - Debt statement:

WE hold the defaulted student loan and the entire balance is now due
Principal Balance (as of 11/21/25): \$22,001.05
Interest: \$3,166.83
Total Balance: \$35,167.88
The dept intends to report my debt to the US treasure for collection through treasury offset (tax refunds, social security benefits, and federal travel reimbursements)
wage garnishment, litigation, up to 15% of my social security

Here’s a compassionate, well-structured **administrative discharge request letter** you can submit to the **U.S. Department of Education (Default Resolution Group or Federal Student Aid Office)** to request forgiveness based on *severe financial hardship and job loss.*

This version focuses on **financial hardship, loss of income, and risk of offset/garnishment**, framed in a formal and respectful tone.

Subject: Request for Administrative Loan Discharge Due to Financial Hardship  

Dear Default Resolution Officer,  

I am writing to urgently request an administrative discharge or full forgiveness of my defaulted federal student loan due to extreme financial hardship.  

As of November 21, 2025, my balance statement shows the following:  
- **Principal Balance:** $22,001.05  
- **Interest:** $3,166.83  
- **Total Balance:** $35,167.88  

I recently lost my job and currently have **no source of income** other than two months of severance pay, which is all I have to support my family through the winter. This limited income is insufficient to cover even our basic living expenses, including rent, utilities, and food. Once these modest funds are depleted, I will have no means to make payments on my student loans or any other significant obligations.  

I am deeply concerned by the notice that my debt may be sent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for collection through **tax refund offset, wage garnishment, and potential Social Security withholding**. At this time, these measures would cause significant and irreversible hardship for my household, as we have no sustainable income or assets to absorb such losses.  

I respectfully request that the Department of Education exercise its administrative authority to **suspend collection actions** and **discharge the full remaining balance** on the grounds of total financial hardship, inability to repay, and unemployment. I am prepared to provide supporting documentation, including:  
- Proof of job separation and loss of income  
- Severance statement  
- Recent bank statements or household expense records  
- Any additional information needed to verify financial hardship  

I have acted in good faith throughout this process and remain grateful for the partial forgiveness previously applied to my loans. I now ask for your reconsideration and compassion in evaluating this request, given my current inability to generate income or maintain basic living stability.  

Thank you for your time, understanding, and attention to my circumstances. I hope to resolve this matter through administrative relief and to avoid further financial distress that collection actions would cause.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]

Would you like this version adapted into a **"financial hardship + temporary deferment" version** (if you hope to postpone payments rather than discharge immediately), or keep it focused on **permanent loan forgiveness/discharge** due to total inability to pay?
