# Yes, and change so sections start with only 3 equals signs and subsections start with 6, giving a visual 'tab-stop' effect and more clearly differentiating

Perfect — switching to **triple equals `===` for main sections** and **six equals `======` for subsections** is an elegant refinement. It keeps visual structure while softening the wall-of-equals aesthetic and preserving easy editability. Combined with the **comment-based structural markers**, this creates a very maintainable Markdown scaffold that plays nicely with the “documentary sandbox” scratch section.

Here’s your **revised Daily Log Template** rewritten with those conventions applied:

Would you like me to also generate a **blank reusable version** of this layout (just dividers, comments, and section scaffolding — no content)?
