### When I created my user account last week, (or some other time in the past), my password worked fine.  Now it does not work at all.

### Where can I find a backup copy of my Lotus Notes id file?

### How do I give someone permission to view my files/directories?

The following command will let you set permissions for a user.  Owner of file or dir must send us a request before we will change permissions.

	fs sa [userid] [rlidwka]

Thus if you want to give user ‚Äúsuperman2k‚Äù all permission to everything in a directory, cd to that directory and type:

	fs sa superman2k all

If you want to give someone permissions on files that you do not own, you should ask the owner of those files or directories first to make sure it is okay with them.  If you do not know who the owner is you can use the following command sequence to find that out:

### To find out who has permission to the current directory:

	fs la

If superman2k needs to access the file /afs/rchland.ibm.com/usr8/techgrp3/villains.1950.txt, he first needs to find out who owns the file villains.1950.txt.  He can do this one of two ways ...

### How do I keep unauthorized personel from accessing my files?

### How to troubleshoot lpstat showing a printer is down

If a customer is having printer issues and upon issuing and `lpstat` command you determine the printer is down, there are a few things you can try before routing to printer support.

- Run `qdef up`. Repeat if it doesn't work -- sometimes it just takes multiple tries.
- Try deleting the top few jobs to see if that releases the queue.
- Power the connection off-and-on.
- Run `/etc/qconfig`
- Ping host with `ping [hostname]`
- Ensure network cables are securely plugged in

If that doesn't solve the issue, the next step is to contact Network Printer Support.
