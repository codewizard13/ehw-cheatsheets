Shoulder Injury Nearly Ended My Playing — Can I Still Shred? 🎸



Great — here's a **revised version** of the video description based on your updated title:

---

### **Title:**

**Shoulder Injury Nearly Ended My Playing — Can I Still Shred? 🎸**

---

### **Description:**

⚠️ **Note:** This is *not* a guitar lesson or instructional video. It’s more of a personal recovery vlog / demo / test as I work around a rotator cuff injury and try to rebuild my speed and technique.

---

🗓️ **Recorded: October 8, 2025**

After a rotator cuff injury to my right shoulder, I’ve been slowly working my way back to playing. In this video, I experiment with different seated and standing guitar positions to find what allows me to play with the least pain — and the most control.

I play short excerpts from well-known thrash metal songs (Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, etc.) as benchmarks to see what’s still physically possible.

This is part of a broader recovery journey — if you're going through something similar, I hope it helps you feel less alone.
