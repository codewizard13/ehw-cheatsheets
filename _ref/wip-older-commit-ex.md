## _ref/demo/commit-ex.md (July 7, 2025)

Yes, your commit message can be made more granular by specifying exactly which sections were reorganized, what was moved or grouped, and how the media queries were clarified. Here are two granular options:

---

**Option 1:**

üßπ [00.01.45] _nav.scss - Refactor: Granular reorganization of media queries and responsive styles

- Grouped XS (`max-width: $breakpoint-xs`) and SM (`max-width: $breakpoint-sm`) media queries into distinct, clearly labeled sections.
- Moved all mobile-specific navigation, button, and mega menu display rules into their respective breakpoints.
- Consolidated hamburger menu variable declarations and animation styles under SM breakpoint for clarity.
- Ensured all responsive overrides (e.g., `.col-l`, `.col-r`, `.btns-grp-2ndry`, `.btn-grouping`) are scoped to the correct media query.
- Moved debug border rule to the bottom for easier toggling/removal.
- **Business Impact**: Improves maintainability and onboarding by making responsive logic easier to follow and update, reducing risk of style conflicts across breakpoints.

---

**Option 2:**

‚ôªÔ∏è [00.01.45] _nav.scss - Refactor: Split and clarify responsive SCSS by breakpoint and component

- Split media queries into XS and SM sections, each containing only the relevant overrides for navigation, buttons, and mega menu.
- Grouped all hamburger/mobile menu variables and animation styles under the SM breakpoint for single-responsibility.
- Scoped `.btns-grp-2ndry`, `.btn-grouping`, and menu visibility toggles to their respective breakpoints for easier future edits.
- Relocated debug border rule to file end for developer convenience.
- **Business Impact**: Makes responsive navigation styling more modular and predictable, reducing developer time spent tracing style overrides and improving reliability of mobile/desktop navigation behavior.


---




üõ†  [00.01.37 HeaderSearchIcon]  top-mega-menu.php - TEMP style for mobile search dropdown, fix duplicate search toggler ID

- Temporarily added `<style>` block to push `#mobile-search-dropdown-wrapper` 88px from the top for proper mobile overlay positioning (to be moved to _nav.scss in a future refactor).
- Changed search toggler button ID in the right column of the header from `#mobile-search-icon-btn` to `#desktop-search-icon-btn` to prevent duplicate ID conflicts between mobile and desktop search toggles.

- **Business Impact**: Ensures correct mobile search dropdown placement and eliminates potential JavaScript/CSS issues caused by duplicate element IDs, improving navigation reliability and maintainability.




---



‚ú® feat(scripts): Add script to extract and deduplicate URLs from nested JSON

- Introduced `dedup-urls-json.js`, a Node.js script to parse deeply nested JSON files.
- The script recursively traverses the JSON structure to find all URL values.
- Uses a `Set` to efficiently deduplicate the found URLs.
- Outputs the unique URLs to a specified text file, with each URL on a new line.
- Designed to be run from the command line using `process.argv` for input/output file paths.

- **Business Impact**: Provides a utility to extract and organize URLs from complex data sources, which can be useful for various tasks like sitemaps, data analysis, or content verification.

---






üì±  [00.01.38 HeaderPushdown]  _nav.scss - FIX `.header-content-pushdown` so there are no gaps between it and `#header-top-nav`

- Set `.header-content-pushdown::before` default height to `$header-height-tab` (113px) for improved tablet handling.
- Apply `$header-height-desk` (80px) for `.header-content-pushdown::before` at `min-width: 1024px` for desktop screens.
- Commented out `$header-height-mob` (88px) for mobile, clarifying intent and future use.
- Removed redundant/overlapping media queries and margin-top override for `.header-content-pushdown`.
- Set `#header-top-nav` height to 117px for mobile breakpoint (`max-width: $breakpoint-sm`).
- **Business Impact**: Ensures header ghost element accurately matches header height across breakpoints, preventing content overlap and improving layout consistency.

---


üíÑ  [00.01.39 HeaderMobileTweak]  _nav.scss - Tweak mobile nav spacing and logo sizing for ‚â§768px

- Set `.btn-grouping > button, .btn-grouping > a` padding to `.2rem` for improved button touch targets on mobile.
- Add `.4rem` margin-bottom to `.col-l` for better vertical spacing between stacked columns.
- Limit `.site-logo-header img` to `max-height: 40px` for consistent logo display on small screens.
- **Business Impact**: Enhances mobile navigation usability and visual clarity, ensuring buttons are easier to tap and layout remains clean on devices ‚â§768px.

## REVISED COMMIT MSG FORMAT with separate "Business Impact" and "Gotcha" sections:  2025-07-02, Eric Hepperle

üíÑ  [00.01.40 GuestGrid]  Refactor guest archive loop to use `.guest-grid` CSS Grid layout for precise row and column gaps

**template-parts/**
- `loop/arch-guests.php`: Add `.guest-grid` class to guest loop wrapper for improved style targeting and layout control.
- card-guest-2col.php: Remove inline `max-width` styling and Bootstrap `row`/`col` classes from guest cards to prevent grid conflicts and wrapping issues.

**src/_guests.scss**
- Implement CSS Grid in `.guest-grid` for consistent two-column layout with defined column and row gaps.
- Retain `max-width` on cards to ensure correct sizing for odd card counts.

---

**üöÄ Business Impact:**
Delivers a visually balanced, consistently spaced guest archive grid, improving readability and user experience across all screen sizes.

**‚ö†Ô∏è #GOTCHA:**
While this fixes the grid gap spacing issue, it breaks something such that guest card heights are inconsistent.

---




üíÑ  [00.01.41 GuestSidebarOrder]  Restrict sidebar column order swap to Guests archive only; move logic to _layout.scss for single source of truth

**src/_layout.scss**
- Under `@media (max-width: 768px)`, prefixed `.eh-col-left` with `.post-type-archive-guests` (the body class for the guests archive page) so sidebar order swap only applies to the Guests archive.
- Moved sidebar order logic from `_guests.scss` to `_layout.scss` to centralize control of sidebar ordering for all templates.

---

**üöÄ Business Impact:**
Prevents unintended sidebar order changes on non-guest pages, ensuring only the Guests archive uses the alternate column order on mobile. Simplifies future maintenance by consolidating sidebar order logic in one place.

**‚ö†Ô∏è #GOTCHA:**
If other archive pages need custom sidebar order, they must be added to `_layout.scss`‚Äîthis change removes the previous global override.

# 09/20/25


Generate a detailed yet succinct conventional commit message formatted as follows:  
- Use type `docs` unless clearly another type, with scope equal to the **top-level affected folder** only (e.g., if file is in `guides/github/index.md`, use scope `guides`).  
- If no folder is given or detected for scope, default to `how-to`.  
- Summary line ‚â§70 chars, concise, explaining what and why.  
- If file paths are explicitly provided in the input, group them under their **full relative folder path** (e.g., **guides/github**) as a heading, and list only the filenames beneath.  
- If *no files are specified*, skip the folder and file listing entirely.  
- Everything below the summary line that is not a heading (e.g., all file bullets or changes) must be formatted as bullet items.  
- For each listed file, add up to 6 concise bullet items starting with *Added, Updated, Corrected, Removed, Refactored,* etc., describing the changes.  
- Optionally include a final section prefixed with ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:** for warnings, caveats, or follow-up tasks.  
- Maintain consistent blank lines and indentation for readability.

# 09/24/25


PROMPT:

Generate a detailed yet succinct **conventional commit message** for wordpress theme code changes formatted as follows: ¬†
- Determine `type(scope)` - favor clarity of purpose or section (e.g., if the changes are about wells page then scope should be 'wells', if changes are primarily wpadmin dashboard config then scope = 'wpadmin', etc.)¬†
- If no folder is given or detected for scope, default to `how-to`. ¬†
- Summary line ‚â§70 chars, concise, explaining what and why. ¬†
- If file paths are explicitly provided in the input, group them under their **full relative folder path** (e.g., **guides/github**) as a heading, and list only the filenames beneath. ¬†
- If *no files are specified*, skip the folder and file listing entirely. ¬†
- Everything below the summary line that is not a heading (e.g., all file bullets or changes) must be formatted as bullet items. ¬†
- For each listed file, add up to 6 concise bullet items starting with *Added, Updated, Corrected, Removed, Refactored,* etc., describing the changes. ¬†
- Optionally include a final section prefixed with ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:** for warnings, caveats, or follow-up tasks if warranted. ¬†
- Maintain consistent blank lines and indentation for readability.:



CONTENT:


---


# 09/25/25

Give the current #changes in the #codebase provide a conventional commit in the following format:

Generate a clear, concise conventional commit message after determining what the main content type of this repo is (wordpress theme, plugin, python script, gist, kb docs, etc.):

If the codebase is mostly .md files, then safe to assume 'docs' is the type. Otherwise, determine the likely type based on the codebase content

Summary: Use type(scope) with a scope reflecting main change area (e.g., wells, wpadmin, default how-to); summary line ‚â§70 characters explaining what and why.

File & Folder Paths: If file paths given, group by full folder (e.g., guides/github), list only bolded filenames; omit file listing if none specified.

Details: Use hyphen (-) bullets for details; For each file, up to 4 hyphen bullets starting with Added, Updated, Corrected, Refactored, etc.

Technical Nouns: Backtick filenames, functions, classes, sections, variables.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats:: for warnings, follow-ups.

üìã Codebase Annotations section: Extract all comment annotations like TODO, MAYBE, FIXME, etc., case-insensitively (e.g., todo, TODO, @TODO) into a final üìã Codebase Annotations section, formatting each as a one-line hyphen bullet with their label (e.g., TODO: filename (function): note or MAYBE: filename: note), omitting function parentheses if not present, keeping the list concise and uniform.

Other Layout / Formatting: No horizontal rules between sections; - Maintain consistent blank lines and indentation.




---


Here‚Äôs your refined prompt updated so that **üìã Codebase Annotations only appears if actual annotations are found during a scan**. This prevents empty or misleading sections from being generated.  

***

### Refined Prompt (with Annotations Validation)  

Generate a clear, concise conventional commit message after determining what the main content type of this repo is (e.g., WordPress theme, plugin, Python script, gist, knowledge base docs).  

- If the codebase is mostly `.md` files, assume type = `docs`.  
- Otherwise, determine the likely type based on the contents.  

### Commit Message Format  

Use the format:  
`type(scope): summary`  
- *type* = conventional commit type (feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, chore, etc.)  
- *scope* = main change area (e.g., wells, wpadmin, default-howto, course-notes, etc.)  
- *summary* = one-line, ‚â§70 characters, explains what and why.  

### Change Log Structure  

For changed files, always group them by their **folder**, and under each folder list **only the bolded filenames**. Each file must then have up to **4 bullet points** describing its changes.  

**Example structure:**  

```
refactor(wells): add date constants, refine FAQ usage

**inc**

- `theme-constants.php`  
  - Added `DT` array with `current_year` and `first_of_cur_yr`.  
  - Added `faq_since_date` key to `WELLS_STATS`.  

- `admin.php`  
  - Added TODO for possible deletion or wiki relocation.  

**template-parts/section**

- `pg-wells-faq.php`  
  - Updated FAQ verbiage using dynamic wells stats.  
  - Added TODO to explore accordion FAQ with <details>.
```

### Additional Sections  

After listing all file changes:  

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats**: Global notes, risks, or follow‚Äëup actions.  

- **üìã Codebase Annotations**:  
  - Only include this section *if and only if* actual annotations like `TODO`, `FIXME`, `MAYBE`, `HACK`, or `NOTE` were found in a codebase scan.  
  - Format each as:  
    - `TODO: filename (function if given): note`  
    - `FIXME: filename: note`  
  - If no annotations are detected, omit the entire section.  

### Critical Rule  

- Do not collapse all details into one "Details" section.  
- Every listed file must have its **own change bullets**.  
- Only omit a file entirely if no concrete changes are known.  
- Omit the **üìã Codebase Annotations** section entirely if no annotations are found during scan.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:**  
- Chapter 2 complete; next up is Chapter 3.  
- Consider moving `.ehw-doc-descr` styles into section 9 for consistency.  
- Chapter includes **Boots** and **Spellbook** instructions for future reference.  
- Added chapter-specific References section, intended for adoption in all chapters.

Here is your revised prompt integrating the stronger instructions for more accurate commit type and scope determination:

***

Generate a clear, concise conventional commit message after thoroughly analyzing the main content type of this repo based on the actual changed files.

- Inspect the list of changed files and their extensions carefully before deciding on the commit type.
- If the majority of changed files are `.md` documentation or wiki files, use type = `docs`.
- Otherwise, determine the commit type based on the predominant file types and folder structures:
  - For WordPress theme or plugin PHP/template files, prefer `feat`, `fix`, `style`, or `refactor` with appropriate scope.
  - For Python scripts, use `feat`, `fix`, or `refactor`.
  - For configuration or project files, use `chore`.
- Do not make assumptions or default to `docs` if file evidence points otherwise.
- Explicitly mention the main affected folders and filename patterns as scope.
- Use the format:

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats:
- summary of global notes or follow-up actions.

üìã Codebase Annotations:

feat(banner): add Charlie Kirk memorial banner with quick inline styles

**template-parts/banner**

- `charlie-kirk-memorial.php`  
  - Cloned from `cta/donate-img.php` as a quick-start banner template.  
  - Added inline CSS and custom URL variables for banner layout, styling, and video button with overlay.

**front-page.php**

- Inserted Charlie Kirk memorial banner above top video section.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:**  
- Styles require migration to CSS stylesheet for maintainability.  
- Refactor hard-coded values into configuration constants.  
- Consider consolidating this template part into "cta" folder for consistency.  
- Extract banner background color to SASS variable.

---

feat(banner): refactor Charlie Kirk memorial banner styles and button

**template-parts/banner**

- `charlie-kirk-memorial.php`  
  - Updated button text color to burlywood and added border color on hover with rounded corners for better aesthetics.  
  - Fixed banner opacity by correcting hover selector from `.charlie-banner:hover` to `.charlie-vid-btn:hover`.  
  - Modified Bootstrap classes to improve button width and prevent wrapping on mobile devices.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats:  
- Styles should be migrated to a CSS stylesheet for maintainability.  
- Consider further refactoring hard-coded values into config constants.  
- Created temporary backups of `charlie-kirk-memorial.php` versions for easy diffing. Remove before PR squash.

Generate a clear, concise conventional commit message after thoroughly analyzing the main content type of this repo based on the actual changed files.
Inspect the list of changed files and their extensions carefully before deciding on the commit type.
If the majority of changed files are .md documentation or wiki files, use type = docs.
Otherwise, determine the commit type based on the predominant file types and folder structures:
For WordPress theme or plugin PHP/template files, prefer feat, fix, style, or refactor with appropriate scope.
For Python scripts, use feat, fix, or refactor.
For configuration or project files, use chore.
Do not make assumptions or default to docs if file evidence points otherwise.
Explicitly mention the main affected folders and filename patterns as scope.
Use the format:
text
type(scope): concise summary ‚â§70 characters

**folder1**

- `filename1`  
  - explanation of changes up to 4 bullet points.

**folder2**

- `filename2`  
  - explanation of changes up to 4 bullet points.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats:
- summary of global notes or follow-up actions.

üìã Codebase Annotations:
- Include only if any TODO, FIXME, or NOTE annotations were found.

Keep each listed file's change bullets distinct and specific.
Omit the annotations section if no annotations are found.
This approach ensures commit messages are accurate, descriptive, and correctly scoped by grounding decisions in the actual repo content and changes.

docs(_css): add callout styles for verbatim content sections

### üéì Course: [Boot.dev] - Learn to Code in Python  


**_css**

- `main.css`  
  - Added `.callout` container style with pale ivory background and warm amber border.  
  - Styled code blocks inside callouts with subtle blue-gray background and blue info cue border.  
  - Created `.label-verbatim` class with soft yellow background and amber text, preceded by a scissors icon.  
  - Added CSS rule to remove extra paragraph spacing when wrapped around `.label-verbatim`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats:  
- Styles enhance readability of verbatim text blocks in markdown rendering, gracefully degrading on GitHub.

***

This commit message follows conventional commit guidelines, uses the `docs` type to indicate documentation/styling changes, scopes to the `_css` folder, and accurately describes the new callout styles added.

fix(template-parts/banner, src/_banners.scss, src/_blockquotes.scss, css, package.json, README.md): restyle Charlie Kirk banner for better mobile responsiveness and update theme version

**template-parts/banner**

- Moved inline Charlie Kirk banner styles to new Sass partial _banners.scss  
- Updated banner markup to correct button group class and streamline structure  
- Removed embedded style block from PHP template for cleaner separation of concerns

**src/_banners.scss**

- Added new _banners.scss file to hold Charlie Kirk banner and CTA styles  
- Introduced responsive media queries for improved mobile and tablet layout  
- Defined consistent styling for banner height, button colors, hover states, and layout margins

**src/_blockquotes.scss**

- Removed Charlie Kirk related CTA styles to encourage reuse via _banners.scss  
- Cleaned up redundant styles to simplify existing blockquote styling

**css/app.css, style.css**

- Updated compiled styles reflecting SCSS banner style changes  

**package.json, README.md**

- Incremented theme version from 3.04 to 3.05 in package and style metadata
