# docs(ref, how-to): add commit message library, SOP & env config guides, and expanded troubleshooting

# Description
This PR expands the documentation library with a commit message example archive, improved deployment SOPs, new logo branding, and practical WordPress/theme environment config guides. Additional enhancements include troubleshooting for Google Sheets errors, development process checklists, and better organization of communication/emails, all aimed at improving knowledge sharing, contributor onboarding, and operational clarity.

- Added `_ref/older-commit-ex.md` with archived commit message samples for future curation.
- Introduced a resized KB logo (`logo-ehw-kb-h32.png`) for docs and branding.
- Added multiple new and revised guides under `how-to/unsorted/`, covering WP environment config, deployment, email/auth troubleshooting, commit workflows, and real-world scenarios.
- Updated existing SOPs for clarity and added structure such as checklists and markdown improvements.
- Enhanced communication guidance with templates, email resolution details, and AI-powered examples.

### Commit Message Library & Branding  
*(Files: `_ref/older-commit-ex.md`, `_pix/logos/logo-ehw-kb-h32.png`)*  
- Added initial collection of legacy commit messages for later review and documentation use.
- Created a smaller, standardized KB logo for consistent visual identity in docs and wikis.

### Expanded How-To & Troubleshooting  
*(Files: `how-to/unsorted/*`)*  
- Added and revised guides for WordPress environment awareness, standardized deployment SOP, and troubleshooting Google Sheets validation errors.
- Enhanced structure and formatting for guides, including checklists, TOC improvements, and metadata cleanups.
- Provided communication samples and stepwise real-world troubleshooting cases for email/Docs.

### Additional Guides and Checklists  
*(Files: `how-to/unsorted/*`)*  
- Added commit message checklist and sample templates to guide contributors.
- Introduced new articles comparing development tools (LocalWP vs Docker), Git profile setups, and meeting note templates.
- Archived, renamed, and restructured several templates and how-to files for easier discoverability and future editing.

**Related Issues:**  
- None directly linked  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:**  
- The commit message library is an initial dump; additional vetting and curation are required before broader contributor use.
- Environment config guide notes limitations of `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` and recommends manual validation for unsupported values.
- All updated or new deployment SOPs and guides reference information current as of September 2025.

- Removed inline banner styles and cleaned up markup for improved responsiveness and visual appeal.  
- Made banner button more dominant with larger text, refined hover effects, and mobile-friendly layout.  
- Added new `_banners.scss` for banner and CTA styles and removed redundant CTA styles from `_blockquotes.scss`.  
- Bumped theme version in `package.json`, `README.md`, and `style.css` to 3.05 marking these style updates.

### Banner Markup & Styles

feat(charlie-kirk-banner): add memorial banner & refactor CTA styles

This PR introduces a new **Charlie Kirk memorial banner** with a responsive layout and styled CTA, while also refactoring existing CTA styles into a dedicated partial for improved maintainability. Theme metadata was updated to reflect version 3.05 in line with these style changes. This creates a cleaner style architecture and adds a high-visibility banner for memorial video promotion.

Key highlights:  
- New memorial banner with overlay, button, and responsive refinements.  
- CTA styles extracted from `_blockquotes.scss` into `_banners.scss` and imported cleanly in `app.scss`.  
- Theme version bumped to 3.05 to track the new features and refactor.  

### Home Page Charlie Kirk Banner

*(Files: `front-page.php`, `template-parts/banner/charlie-kirk-memorial.php`)*  

- Added memorial banner above top video using `get_template_part`.  
- Created dedicated template part with:  
  - Overlay background and responsive grid layout.  
  - CTA button linking to memorial video.  
  - Relative paths for URLs (cross-environment safe).  

### Banner & CTA Styles

*(Files: `src/_banners.scss`, `src/_blockquotes.scss`, `src/app.scss`)*  

- Moved all CTA-related styles from `_blockquotes.scss` into a new `_banners.scss`.  
- Updated `app.scss` imports to include `_banners.scss`.  
- Introduced fallback brick-red background color matching the memorial image tones for graceful degradation.  

### Theme Metadata

*(Files: `package.json`, `README.md`, `style.css`)*  

- Updated theme version from 3.04 ‚Üí 3.05.  
- Synced version references across package metadata, stylesheet, and project README.  

### Temp/Backup Files

*(Files: `template-parts/banner/charlie-kirk-memorial.bkp.php`, `template-parts/banner/tmpl_del.php`)*  

- Leftover backup and demo template files added in squashed history.  
- Recommended to delete for housekeeping since excluded from build process already.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:**  
- Banner button text requires final editorial approval.  
- Backup PHP files are currently excluded from build but should be cleaned up at repo level.  
- Ensure cache busting/CDN purge after deploy so stylesheet refactor (banners/CTAs) propagates correctly.

fix(wells): scope Vimeo iframe CSS to single video posts preventing wells map layout breakage

This PR addresses a layout bug on the wells page where the Vimeo video carousel was overlapping the Google Map and preventing it from displaying full width. The issue stemmed from a global CSS rule intended to fix spacing around Vimeo iframes, which inadvertently affected unrelated content areas site-wide.

**Key Highlights:**

- Fixes layout breakage on the wells page caused by overly broad CSS
- Scopes Vimeo iframe wrapper fix to `.single-videos` context only
- Prevents global override of layout styles outside single video posts


### Vimeo Wrapper CSS Fix  
*(Files: `src/cpt/_videos.scss`)*  
- Updated selector to only apply padding and positioning resets to iframe wrappers inside `.single-videos` pages
- Added detailed code comment explaining the reasoning, scope, and limitations of the rule for maintainability


**Related Issues:**  
- Closes [522](https://app.asana.com/1/818686982630211/project/1211397676880813/task/1211520904887569) (Wells page map layout broken by Vimeo embed styling)


‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes & Caveats:**  
- Original issue was introduced in commit `53e39bd1c985` targeting Vimeo padding fixes
- Change does not impact global styles beyond `.single-videos` scope
- Vimeo embeds using raw iframe markup outside `.single-videos` may still require custom classes
- No PHP or layout templates were changed in this PR

Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **detailed and professional Asana comment entry** that summarizes the bug, cause, fix, and includes relevant code snippets and test info. It‚Äôs structured to be easy for teammates or stakeholders to understand the issue and resolution.

### ‚úÖ Vimeo Layout Bug ‚Äì FIXED

**Issue Summary:**
The **wells page** layout was broken ‚Äî the video carousel was overlapping the Google Map, and the map was not rendering at full width. This was caused by a **Vimeo-specific CSS rule** introduced earlier to remove spacing from iframes, which unintentionally affected other content (like the map) due to an overly broad selector.

---

**Root Cause:**
The following CSS rule was globally applied and matched **any `div` containing an `iframe`**, regardless of context:

```scss
/* Previous (too broad) selector */
div:not(.single-vid-iframe-wrapper):has(> iframe) {
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
}
```

This caused divs on unrelated pages (like `.wells-map`) to collapse or overlap content, since the selector wasn‚Äôt limited to just video embeds.

---

**Fix Summary:**
We scoped the CSS rule to **only apply inside `.single-videos`**, which is used on single video post templates. This ensures the Vimeo fix is preserved where it‚Äôs needed, without affecting layout elsewhere.

```scss
/* ‚úÖ Updated selector (scoped fix) */
.single-videos div:not(.single-vid-iframe-wrapper):has(> iframe) {
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
}
```

This rule:

* Targets only divs inside `.single-videos` pages
* Excludes elements with the `.single-vid-iframe-wrapper` class
* Prevents the fix from breaking layout on pages like `/wells/`

---

**Test & Verification:**

* Fix tested on branch: `testing_revert/on_53e39bd1c985`
* Verified on both:

  * `/wells/` ‚Äî layout restored, map renders full-width below carousel
  * Single video post ‚Äî Vimeo spacing fix still works correctly

---

**Commit Reference:**

* PR: `fix(wells,cpt): scope Vimeo iframe CSS to single video posts`
* Related commit: `53e39bd1c985` (source of the original bug)

---

Let me know if you want to link this fix to another task or if we should notify content editors about preferred embed methods (e.g., oEmbed vs raw iframe).

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version or to tailor it to a non-dev stakeholder.
