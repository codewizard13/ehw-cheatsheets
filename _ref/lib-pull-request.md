# docs(ref, how-to): add commit message library, SOP & env config guides, and expanded troubleshooting

# Description
This PR expands the documentation library with a commit message example archive, improved deployment SOPs, new logo branding, and practical WordPress/theme environment config guides. Additional enhancements include troubleshooting for Google Sheets errors, development process checklists, and better organization of communication/emails, all aimed at improving knowledge sharing, contributor onboarding, and operational clarity.

- Added `_ref/older-commit-ex.md` with archived commit message samples for future curation.
- Introduced a resized KB logo (`logo-ehw-kb-h32.png`) for docs and branding.
- Added multiple new and revised guides under `how-to/unsorted/`, covering WP environment config, deployment, email/auth troubleshooting, commit workflows, and real-world scenarios.
- Updated existing SOPs for clarity and added structure such as checklists and markdown improvements.
- Enhanced communication guidance with templates, email resolution details, and AI-powered examples.

### Commit Message Library & Branding  
*(Files: `_ref/older-commit-ex.md`, `_pix/logos/logo-ehw-kb-h32.png`)*  
- Added initial collection of legacy commit messages for later review and documentation use.
- Created a smaller, standardized KB logo for consistent visual identity in docs and wikis.

### Expanded How-To & Troubleshooting  
*(Files: `how-to/unsorted/*`)*  
- Added and revised guides for WordPress environment awareness, standardized deployment SOP, and troubleshooting Google Sheets validation errors.
- Enhanced structure and formatting for guides, including checklists, TOC improvements, and metadata cleanups.
- Provided communication samples and stepwise real-world troubleshooting cases for email/Docs.

### Additional Guides and Checklists  
*(Files: `how-to/unsorted/*`)*  
- Added commit message checklist and sample templates to guide contributors.
- Introduced new articles comparing development tools (LocalWP vs Docker), Git profile setups, and meeting note templates.
- Archived, renamed, and restructured several templates and how-to files for easier discoverability and future editing.

**Related Issues:**  
- None directly linked  

⚠️ **Notes & Caveats:**  
- The commit message library is an initial dump; additional vetting and curation are required before broader contributor use.
- Environment config guide notes limitations of `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` and recommends manual validation for unsupported values.
- All updated or new deployment SOPs and guides reference information current as of September 2025.
