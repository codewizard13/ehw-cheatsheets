**LibreOffice** is a free and powerful office suite, succeeding OpenOffice.org, and widely used globally. It includes applications like Writer for word processing, Calc for spreadsheets, Impress for presentations, and others. The suite is favored for its comprehensive feature set and compatibility with major file formats used by Microsoft Office programs, making it suitable for many users seeking cost-effective office software.

However, LibreOffice faces criticisms for its complex interface and occasional performance issues. Despite these drawbacks, it remains a popular choice, especially among privacy-conscious users who appreciate its open-source nature, allowing them to examine the source code for vulnerabilities. While other paid office suites like **Microsoft 365** and **Google Workspace** are recognized for their stability and user-friendly interfaces, LibreOffice continues to stand out as a viable free alternative for those looking for basic to intermediate office functionalities.

## Suite Components

Here's a list of programs in the LibreOffice productivity suite, with their Microsoft Office counterparts (in parentheses):

- **Calc** (Excel)

- **Impress** (PowerPoint)
- **Base** (Access)

## Strengths

- Works with most desktop operating systems.
- Automatic spell-check in all parts of the suite.

## Weaknesses

- Must install the whole suite at once (can't install just Writer, etc.).

## History

LibreOffice (/ÀàliÀêbr…ô/)[10] is a free and open-source office productivity software suite, a project of The Document Foundation (TDF). It was forked in 2010 from OpenOffice.org, an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice. It consists of programs for word processing; creating and editing spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams, and drawings; working with databases; and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in 115 languages.[8] TDF does not provide support for LibreOffice, but enterprise-focused editions are available from companies in the ecosystem.[11]
